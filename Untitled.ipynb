      "[\"I received my Yeti 20oz with Mugslider lid. Looks great, well built. But after a hour or two, coffee is cold. While driving, the coffee will leak past the lid, and proceed to drip, all over your cars interior. I was hoping for something better. I also liked the information pamphlet that can with the cup talking about liquid viscosity, and how cold liquid is thicker, than hot, so hot liquid will have a tendency to leak around our Mugslider lids. Here's and idea, how about making a lid that doesn't leak when you put hot liquid in a cup???I digress, TLDR don't buy if you want to use it for hot liquid i.e. coffee.\", 'Counterfeit piece of junk!  The rambler pictured shows the magnetic slider lid.  The rambler I received shipped from China and came with a cheap piece of plastic lid with no magnetic closure.  I do not believe the tumbler is even vacuum sealed as hot coffee turns cold in a matter of minutes.  It is deplorable that Amazon allows counterfeit sales like this.', 'I ordered the Yeti Rambler 20 oz with the MagSlide Lid. Although the package description says “w/ MagSlide Lid”, the tumbler came with a regular lid. Very disappointing!', \"I was spooked by the warnings of ''Fake Yeti'' cups.  I don't think any of these are made in Texas any longer, although they once were, hence the warnings about fakes.  My local ACE Hardware sells the complete line of Yeti products.  I checked a bunch of those, and all were ''Fake'' according to some of these warnings.  I decided to order from Amazon simply so I could get the nice aqua-blue color -- and to get the nifty sliding cover, which my ACE does not carry.  The color is beautiful, and the sliding cover is nearly -- though not completely -- leak proof.  The cover seals well enough for my purposes, which is to rest in the truck cup holder.  Yeti makes cups with screw on tops which could be dropped into a backpack.  I could buy one of those from the local ACE if I ever need one.  Photo included.  Notice I have washed the YETI and have removed the cap so that it can evaporate and dry here on the kitchen counter-top in my photo.\", 'The product description states it is a yeti cup with a mag slider lid. All that was included was a cheap off brand plastic lid! I ordered two feeling I was getting the mag slider lid as well! Disappointed!', \"My cup leaks. When I tilt the cup to take a sip the liquid gets under the lid and seal and drips all over me. I'm super bummed. The cup is Super pretty and keeps my cold coffee cold but I just dripped coffee down my shirt and it's not the first time.  I checked about exchanging it and apparently I'm a couple of days late for that. I'd buy this again if it weren't making a mess everywhere and ruining my clothes. I'm assuming this is a glitch because everybody else has such positive reviews. I emailed about an exchange, fingers crossed.EDIT: I wrote an email and got a very quick response. They sent me a new lid and it has changed my life. haha I could tell as soon as I put the lid on that it fit differently and it would seal. And it does! I love my cup, I love their customer service.\", 'Came with two lids, but neither was the magslider and both were cracked. Overall, pretty unsatisfied.', 'I purchased a few Yetis stateside which have the real mag slider. This mug is counterfeit from China.', 'Hesitated spending this amt of $$ on a mug especially considering the premium YETI name and outlandish pricing.I finally decided to part with my $$ thinking I’d be swindled by yet another clever marketing ploy. I was pleasantly surprised. Everything on the mug made sense build quality and it does exactly as the brands itself. Whether hot or cold, this mug holds temp for what seems like forever?My only gripe is that you can easily forget how well it maintains hot coffee even after sitting for an hour. So much that if not careful, you can burn your lips from the scalding temp of your coffee.The cleaning is simple and even the tlmfr’s name that this thing is so over-engineered that it can withstand dishwashers to keep it simple.Enjoyed it so much I purchased 6 more as gifts.Still questionable whether I’ll buy a $300 cooler, but the YETI brand has made me a believer.', \"This is a really great Tumbler-- it keeps the coffee hot/warm for hours, holds a lot of liquid, is super easy to clean, and really sleek looking.There are a couple of drawbacks, however.--If you have smaller hands, this particular one does not fit comfortably in your hand. This, paired with how heavy it is makes it somewhat difficult to hold during long commutes (mine is about an hour +).--Although it is pretty spill-proof, the top leaks a bit at the mouth portion, even with the magnetic closure closed. Granted, it doesn't spill over the edge, it's just slightly concerning to be on the bus/train and look down to see coffee bubbling up.\", \"I own multiple YETI products, and this is the first issue I've had with one of their products.  Water was seeping out from where the base meets the rest of the mug.  I tugged on the base and it came off in my hands, and there was water that got in there, probably from the dishwasher.  The base will not reattach, and was pressure sealed.  I called Yeti yesterday, waited on hold for over an hour, and then was told that this was not uncommon and to fill out their warranty claim online.  I did so, and included the same pics you see here.  Here's the response:Hi Ron!Thanks for reaching out to YETI.We are sorry to hear about your experience. Based off the information you have provided it appears as though your tumbler was customized using a 3rd party customization process which is not covered directly under our warranty. That said, we recommend contacting the original seller in order to inquire on their specific warranty related information.To ensue you are always receiving authentic YETI gear, we recommend purchasing directly from YETI.com or from one of our authorized retailers you may find at the bottom of our site under “store locator.”Thanks for reaching out to us, and we will be sure to pass this information along to our brand protection team.Best regards,The YETI Outfitterseniquer512.394.9384customerservice@yeti.comThere was no third party customization.  Their response was bizarre.  I am posting this here because I bought this on Amazon, and am apparently out of luck because I didn't buy it on yeti.com, or an authorized retailer.\", \"I have a few YETI ramblers that have been given to me by various companies, thus they all have the branding and logos for those companies.  They all work well for keeping my drinks, almost always ice water, cold.  This one is no different.  Here in Houston, I can have it with two large cubes, with me in and out of the car all day, multiple water refills, sitting in the heat, and by the time I have made it home there are still two, albeit smaller, ice cubes.I am not sure if it just a perception thing, but I don't think this particular rambler does as well as my other, all silver, YETI 20oz.  It seems like the silver one does an even better job at keeping things cold, but maybe I am just imagining that.  Either way, I am happy.\", 'Overall I\\'m happy with this rambler with a few minor gripes. I did a lot of research and watched countless comparison and review videos on YouTube to decide between this or the competition.While other brands have been proven to keep hots hot and colds cold for longer durations of time, this rambler is easier to to open for drinking and easier to dismantle for cleaning.Everyone has a different opinion on what temperature they consider hot and what temperature they consider cold. For myself I\\'ve found that this rambler works better for hots opposed to colds.Ice doesnt seem to last more than 1 to 2 hours even if the Beverage poured in is already cold from the fridge.18 to 20 oz of hot black coffee will still be warm 7 to 8 hours later if I do not touch it until that 7 hour mark. Everytime I open the lid to drink, some heat gets released thus bringing down the temperature.From what I\\'ve seen on YouTube and read here on Amazon, it seems like theres a 50/50 shot if someone gets a good lid or a great lid. Yeti advertises the mag lid as being spill \"resistant\", not spill \"proof\".Here\\'s what it comes down to, the sliding magnet cover. Some videos show this rambler being held upside down with not even a drop leaking. Other videos show liquid leaking from the sliding magnet.Absolutely nothing leaks through the inner gasket around the lid which is great. Mine does unfortunately leak from the magnet sliding cover.If yeti could figure out how design the lid to guarentee the sliding magnet would not leak and it would hold temperature for just a few more hours, then I believe yeti could have a monopoly on the market.', 'Thank you Yeti for inventing this amazing device. I was getting tired of lapping my Kool-Aid off the floor.- Appears to keep things cold, but I don’t usually keep drinks in the same cup for 24 hours in direct sunlight because I’m not an insane person.- Appears to not leak, but I’m proud to report that I haven’t had a problem keeping cups upright since about age 5, except for a brief period between age 19 and 22.- When I drink from this cup other men know I’m an alpha and women can detect that I’m good mating potential because of my obvious manliness.- On a serious note, the magnetic lid is very nice because it allows you to clean it properly. Yeti, you may have 1 extra caramel.', 'Not happy with it’s insulating capabilities.  The Contigo travel mug I bought at Target works better!!  Bad lid design. Not worth 30 bucks for sure. And I bought 7 of these as gifts for all my adult kids because everyone raves about what a great product YETI is.  YETI should redesign the lid, and then offer a free replacement to everyone who bought this particular mug.', \"I wasn't necessarily a huge skeptic, but I did wonder what all the hype was about. After using this almost daily, it definitely lives up to its reputation. I love the simple look and it actually does hold the temperature inside incredibly well. I use this as a bring-my-own-cup option at coffee shops and it has the added benefit of keeping the coffee hot for hours. I  also love that the sip cover is magnetic and comes off - which makes it easier to clean and feel good that nothing is getting stuck in that small space. I love it!\", 'I’ll start by saying that I held off on buying these for about a year now. I had assumed that it was more of a trend kinda thing and the experience was being exaggerated. Officially, I’d say I was wrong.All in all, it’s a great product and works really well at keeping drinks cold and slowing melting ice substantially. We bought two of these a couple weeks ago right before our trip to Mexico. It was about 95* with a “Real Feel” of about 105*. We had our drinks in these out in the sun and it took the ice a good 3 hours or so to melt completely in that temperature. Even after the ice melted, the drink stayed reasonably cool for another hour or two. Cold beer in them stayed cold long enough for me to finish the whole thing.Overall, I’d say I’m quite pleased. I will note though, I did some research (after purchasing) and only certain products (and not all) are made overseas. If you’re looking to buy a US made product, you have to contact them and request it specifically, or go with a different brand. If that’s important to you, do your research first or contact them.', \"Authentic Yeti. I tested it immediately upon receipt and here are the test results: I poured boiling water into it and checked after 3 hours to find it still piping hot that could give you a burn. I repeated the test, this time, only fill the tumbler to half to test how it performs with only half the volume. The water is still very, very hot after 5 hours. It's temperature dropped a bit after 6 hours, but it's still quite hot. I could still feel a bit of warmth after another 11 hours!It's amazing how a little tumbler can keep liquid hot for so long. It performs way better than my Swell water bottle and it's way cheaper than a Swell.One thing is that the packing isn't that good . I think probably for that reason, it came with a small dent on the rim. I could actually feel the Yeti wobbled like crazy inside the box when it arrived. I would have given it a 5-star if it wasn't for the dent.Before I decide to go ahead and buy, I read the review here and noticed a number of people said they've bought a fake Yeti. The thing is, Yeti Authorized is the only authorized seller on Amazon according to Yeti's website. So if you choose to buy from other sellers, the authenticity will be uncertain. And don't choose colors like olive, camouflage, cos they are not colors shown on Yeti's website, meaning they are not really made by Yeti but some knock off. Hope it helps.\", \"The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Great with coffee, beer, and water, which are really the only things I drink with it. Love the magnetic lid piece and that it is leak-proof. When there is boiling water in the cup it is never so hot that you can't hold it.\", 'I love Yeti products, and was honestly disappointed with this mug. After reading the directions I realized that the lid is not at all leak proof, especially with hot liquids. Even the lid itself has a manufacturers note that it’s not the best at keeping hot liquids in. Knowing all that, I tried just plain water with some ice, and kept the tumbler closed upright in a cooler. To my dismay, by the time we walked over front he car to the beach all of the tumbler contents have spilled all over the cooler. For a good product I just don’t understand why would YETI not make a leak proof lid? I’m terribly disappointed because I can’t imagine myself taking this tumbler anywhere except into my car for morning coffee and leaving it on my desk. It would be impossible to leave it in a backpack because it will definitely spill. I’m not sure if the lids I have are just totally defective, but seeing that the label on the tumbler warned against spills I’m suspicious that it’s just not a great lid.If you’re looking for a spill proof tumbler, this one sadly is not it :/', 'I love YETI, but the magslider lid that was promised is all clear and not a YETI lid.  The lid is very cheaply made and does not stay closed. Returning item', 'For those concerned about counterfeit Yeti I figured out how some reviewers possibly received fake items and others didn’t. Different colors of the tumbler have different sellers but all are sold under the same item listing. Anyone who buys the item reviews in the same place. The seller Yeti Authorized definitely sells real Yeti items. For example the tumbler I bought from Yeti Authorized is real. It came with the “register your Yeti” booklet and the scannable square barcode thingy (I forget what it’s called) sticker on the bottom. It’s also heavy-ish and clearly has an acrylic lid with the mag slider. So when buying Yeti off amazon you need to buyer beware and check the seller of the item. I’m not suggesting that Yeti Authorized is the only seller of real Yeti on amazon. I’m saying that I received a real tumbler from them AND a seller with the brand name in its seller name is much more likely to be selling real items, according to research I did on counterfeit goods on amazon.Aside from that my tumbler is great. It’s definitely a quality item but at $30 I don’t expect something completely indestructible. Unlike some reviews I don’t put mine in the dishwasher. Also I don’t see how it’s necessary to do so given that mine always rinses/washes nicely. One thing to keep in mind is that this tumbler works so well that *too hot* coffee will stay too hot in the Yeti for hours. So a few times I’ve had to take the lid off to let it cool. All in all I’d say it’s worth the $30. I’m planning on getting the larger tumbler with straw and the larger bottle for the summer.', 'I bought these because the Contigo coffee mugs I had were staining pretty bad and leaving a bad taste in my coffee.  There\\'s so much hype about these Yeti\\'s and I can\\'t tell you how disappointed I am.  First, they make this big hoopla about the magnet top.  Its worthless.  Yes, they say \"made from real magnets\", like, woohoo, who cares?  the Contigo lock locks.  it keeps things from pouring out.  This magnet acts like a passive suggestion to the coffee to stay put.  The contigo comes with a rubber-like wrap that helps with grip.  The Yeti is so smooth they might as well have made the outside from vaseline.  It doesnt keep coffee as warm as long as Contigo, which i attribute to the weak magnetic slide.  I am hoping at the very least the metal inside doesn\\'t stain like the Contigo.  In short, if I hadn\\'t had the contigo (cheaper than these and come in pairs at Costco) my review would be better.  This mug isn\\'t bad, its just knowing how much better the competition is makes this look worse.', 'A full 20 oz cup of scalding hot coffee cooled to lukewarm in 2.5 hours sitting unopened on a table inside a warm room.  Lid leaks profusely when closed. Hot coffee doesn’t drip or slowly leak, it literally gushes out the closed lid in a 2” long stream...through a CLOSED LID.  Unlike Yeti’s enclosed explanation of liquid viscosity suggesting hot fluids are more likely to leak than cold fluids, having a 2” long stream of hot coffee gushing out of a closed lid does not even happen in my much less expensive Target brand Chinese thermal cups.', 'I am not into designer labels, big names, etc. but I love this tumbler.  I can see why this brand is superior to the \"knock-offs\".  First of all, it doesn\\'t have any interior seams. Second, it is dishwasher safe. Third, it comes with a serial number that is registered with the manufacturer and has a 5 year warranty.  The lid is extremely easy to open and close with the flip of a thumb - essential if you\\'re going to use this while driving.  I am extremely pleased - so much so that I bought another one.', 'The info that came w the tumbler said that the lid is not leakproof. OK, understood. What I don’t understand is how it can leak when it’s in your hand and you’re standing still. I imagined it wouldn’t be leak proof if it’s in the truck and you’re off roading but when the act of standing in one place and trying to drink makes it leak it seems like a failed product.It doesn’t keep hot drinks hot the way my cheap Contigo brand tumbler does. There needs to be something around it to grip because it’s just slick stainless steel and it can slide from your hand easily. Do not even try opening the lid once you have a hot drink in there. Just don’t. Or wear an apron and do it in the sink because you have to force the lid open.$30. My no name tumbler from Walgreens is far superior.', 'Let me start by explaining I am a coffee snob. I usually purchase end up purchasing expensive coffee. But I can’t drink it before I work out.  And it sucked when I would finish my workout and find that my “insulated” coffee mug only kept it lukewarm.  Ruined my coffee. No longer. Enter the Yeti. This thing keeps my coffee crazy hot.  I also drink a ton of tea. I have to be careful using my Yeti mug because the first time I seriously burned the roof of my mouth and tongue. After I had let it sit on my desk for half an hour.  I was suffering through a cold and put my tea on my bedside table, sipping it when I started to cough. It was still warm in the morning ( not hot, but certainly warmer than room temperature). I don’t have to work outside, but if I did, this is the mug I would want.', \"Leaked and decided to go back to a cups I can buy at Target.I had really hoped that I would have a good experience because the packaging, size, and all of the features it was supposed to have really attracted me.At the end of the day though it would leak when I used it to drink out of.For the price I'm not going to Monkey around I just returned it and headed off to Target. The cups I buy at Target aren't as cute but they don't leak on me.\", 'I got a new job and was using a random coffee tumbler for a while. My drive is about an hour long and I drink about half of my coffee on the way to work and the other half there. Issue was my coffee would be lukewarm once I got to work, and sometimes I would make tea later on and it wouldn’t stay warm for over an hour. I decided to get a yeti after using my moms one day and noticing the difference in temperature and longevity. Absolutely worth it. I’ve been using it at home on weekends as well. I live in new england so the house is usually cold in the morning during these months and coffee in a regular mug only stays hot for 10 minutes or so before going tepid. I normally have to put my coffee in the microwave 3 or 4 times just to keep it warm, but the yeti keeps it piping hot for hours and I can take my time sipping on it. Overall so happy and impressed with this product.', 'I bought one of these because it was the same price as my favorite vacuum sealed coffee cup. I like this cup and the new mag slide lid but it does not form a seal that will keep it from spilling if tipped over. The lid will keep it from splashing if it’s upright in a car going over speed bumps, for example. For my every day coffee cup that gets tossed in a bag for my commute, it’s back to the Thermos Sipp', 'While fine print clarifies it’s not leak proof, principally purchased to have a leak proof tumbler. Fully admit I presumed for $30 and being Yeti...  it’d be leak proof.  So lesson learned: even if you have a perception of a particular brand...  still pays to do your research. If it’s knocked over, even with lid sealed, it’ll leak. Not a river, but enough to ruin paper, soil carpet, get whatever’s inside on electronics. Otherwise, it’s as advertised. It’d be nice if the lack of leakproofing and what spillproof means were more prominently displayed/ discussed/ clarified. Judging from other’s comments, it appears this is a common misconception (or source of misunderstanding).', \"I don't know what the other people are saying about fakes. This Yeti is 100% legit. It has the mag slider lid and keeps my drinks hot as hot and cold as cold! Highly reccomend.\", \"Great product! I wish is was leak proof. But, your coffee stays hot! I haven't tried anything cold, so that I can't speak to. But!, I love it.  (I bought a good one from starbucks years ago, and lost it, was never able to replace it--they changed something...) This is better, by far! Except for the leak proof feature. I love the lid, with the removable glider, for easier cleaning.  After, I purchased it, I was so thrilled with it, I bought one for my daughter. If you're going to get the 30 oz, I recommend purchasing the handle as well, unless your hands are large or opt for the 20 oz. Almost perfect!\", 'Bought this for my husband as a surprise thinking it would be better than the no name stainless steel I use. Was very disappointed when I tested the same number of ice cubes in each and left them on the counter overnight. The Yeti had water with no ice and my no name had two ice cubes in it the next morning.  I was quite surprised so don’t really think it’s worth the extra money just for the name.', 'I wanted to love my Yeti Rambler, but it failed at the one most important thing I bought it for. Yes, it is well made, strong, attractive and keeps things hot/cold a really long time, but unfortunately the magslide top isn’t leakproof. I bought this to use on the go and be confident that if it got knocked over, it wouldn’t leak. Unfortunately, it fails that test.I know other reviewers mentioned that it’s not leakproof, but I made the mistake of seeing it a local store where the salesgirl assured me that magslide lids are indeed leakproof...should have done more research.I require something that’s easy to open/close with one hand even when you’re being bounced around in turbulence, and if it tips over, I can’t have it spilling all over my vehicle. Sadly, this Yeti isn’t that, and the price is high for just another insulated coffee cup.', 'I just received this so I can not comment on durability.  Considering the price and all the \"hoopla\" that comes with the Yeti name, you would think they could make this leak proof.  I guess I was hoping it would be but the enclosed information clearly states \"leak resistant\".  Even that is a stretch.  It leaks.  The outer layer is slippery and the tumbler is wide so holding it isn\\'t easy.', \"I recently received the 20oz rambler stainless steel color for a birthday gift. I've had other insulated mugs but this one just puts the competition to shame. On how long the rambler keeps the coffee hot. Yes I said HOT like fresh out of the pot hot for well over two hours. My wife was so impressed with the Yeti that I surprised her with one in Brick Red she loves it. I think the slide on the lid helps out a lot keeping the beverage hot.\", 'These are awesome, if you get the real thing. Be aware -I purchased 10 Yeti Rambler 20 Oz for a group event. Five of them were fake. The 3 Tahoe Blue ones were obvious. The logo on the mag slider lid was way off, and the whole lid was so poorly constructed the slider didn\\'t only not seal, it would just fall off.  The two Olive Green from the same seller are an improved version - knock-off 2.0. Better, but still lacking quality. The lid almost fooled me into thinking it was real, but was still not quite right. I noticed neither lid had anything stamped on the underside, like the real Yeti. The logo on the front was also off, smaller, wrong font, and the way imprinted shows a definite lack of quality compared to the real thing, the bottom logo too. The sticker font was wrong and obviously fake, and they came with a cheap card inside instead of a full color brochure. The fake ones came in boxes, while the real thing comes with plastic protectors, and wrapped in a plastic bag.I am returning the 5 fakes and left a negative review for the seller. I purchased 5 from the local Dicks Sporting Goods today, and compared them to the five sold by \"Yeti Authorized\" on Amazon - and indeed those appear real.', 'I love yeti, but the wrong color arrived and I had to pay the postage to return it, and then couldn’t get a replacement before Christmas. Not great.', 'I bought the 20 oz Rambler and the separate handle as a gift and am deeply regretting all of it. Yes it insulates the beverage for a while, but seriously, all double walled vacuum tumblers do that these days, and the truth is the cheaper Chinese knockoffs that cost half as much do it just as well as Yeti does. So I knew I would be paying extra for the fit and finish and for what I figured would be a better designed lid in the \"new\" MagSlider lid. The fit and finish is top notch, the powder Duracoat looks great and very durable, and the lid looked to be excellent as well. Looking closer, it seemed the MagSlider lid has a wonderful double rubber flange on it that seems perfect for sealing liquids inside and preventing messy accidents. Great so far!Everything seemed wonderful, except that in use, the MagSlider lid actually leaks even in the closed position. Worse yet, this doesn\\'t even seem to be a defective product, just a simple design flaw, in the sense that they surprisingly failed to account for the fact that consumers would want their liquid containers to actually contain the liquid inside them and not allow them to leak out when in any position besides exactly vertical. Apparently, Yeti thinks that for $30 you should expect nothing more than gravity to keep your coffee from spilling out of your Rambler.So, why? Why would you design a premium priced tumbler that utterly FAILS at one of the simplest tasks you demand from a liquid container? Even the cheap Chinese knockoffs at a third of the price have being leakproof as a basic quality. What good are the premium materials and lovely powder coat Duracoat finish if this thing leaks like crazy when it inevitably falls over? I really don\\'t understand why the crack Yeti design team couldn\\'t design a better lid at this price point for something they market as suitable for an active outdoors life. This design isn\\'t suitable for a boring morning highway commute to an office cubicle though, let alone a day of getting knocked around on a work site or a boat.I had a similar experience with the Yeti Colster, which is $25 and two pieces for the simple task of keeping a can cold. Meanwhile a Thermos can cooler is $5, one piece, weighs significantly less, and keeps a can exactly as cold as the vastly overdesigned Yeti Colster.It really feels like they don\\'t know what they\\'re doing down there at Yeti HQ. Honestly, how do you manage to serially OVERdesign products yet UNDERdesign them at the same time? I\\'m highly disappointed in this company, as a premium priced product they should not be failing the basics of everyday utility. The Rambler is supposed to be one of their signature products. Before this I was considering buying one of their extremely spendy coolers, but I\\'ve completely struck that from my mind. Between this tumbler/lid and the Colster they\\'ve fooled me twice now, but they won\\'t be fooling me again. Goodbye Yeti!', 'What a piece of ****Does not keep coffee hot longer than my $12 target cup. In fact the coffee gets cold faster. The top sucks, and spills everywhere.  My target cup never spills out.', 'Bought this as a gift and I love Yeti! My husband and I are Yeti fanatics. We have bought just about everyone in our family circle a Yeti and none else compares. Highly recommend this product to everyone!', \"After a fellow guest at a B&B praised his Yeti up and down, I decided to get one. And yes, it keeps stuff cold for hours even in a very hot car. I have not tried it with a hot beverage, but I assume it would work the same. It is almost leak-proof: I filled it about 2/3 full, closed the lid, and turned it upside down. A few drops fell. It's sturdy and well-made. It doesn't sweat, though the metal band at the top does. The metal band on the bottom does not sweat.\", 'OK I’m really sad about this. Heard of the brand, I have the chairs, read the reviews, said it would keep your drink hot or cold. I want it for hot coffee. Made me a cuppa coffee put it in this thing within minutes it was cool not hot. Stuck it in the microwave, it appeared to be a microwave safe. Took it out no change in the temperature. I’ll try to three times and it more cold my coffee than it originally was so I returned it. I have several cold Type cups that work well. I just wanted something that will keep my coffee really hot in this did not do it in anyway shape or form', 'My cup rocks because it arrived with a big ring to the bottom if it. Very frustrating!!', 'I am a coffee junkie. Truly. As such, I’ve been through an alarming number of both travel mugs and water jugs over the years. Trudeau, Zojirushi (2), Contigo, along with the standard brands. You name it and I’ve tried it. This is my first Yeti. If I’d known earlier I’d have bought it one or more likely two years ago and would probably still have it.The good: I don’t have large hands, but this is still easy to hold. The finish isn’t slippery and seems to have a bit of grip to it. Coffee (hot or cold), cider, just about anything stays hot or cold as long as it lasts.It’s incredibly easy to clean. The magnets on the lid are an inspiration. That the slide comes off for cleaning is another one.The bad: the lid is really the only drawback. It doesn’t give much insulation and doesn’t screw in. All these things make for easy cleaning, but also deplete its heat and cold retention.My husband was making fun of my new coffee mug the very instant he saw that lid. As he was washing it out he put the lid on, flipped it over and started shaking it. Luckily the sipper slide was closed. Probably he thought he could get the lid to fall off. It didn’t. It did lose some water through the sipper, but not as much as he or I thought. He kept laughing and shaking. He got over the laughing. Now he wants one when his breaks.I noticed they make an alternate cap for the ramblers. I wish they made that same style cap for the tumblers. The bottles are really too big or too small for coffee, the main thing I use this for, naturally.I’m sure I’ll be back with another star in a few months.Mine came from Yeti Authorised, shipped by Amazon and if it’s a knockoff it’s a darn good one. But I’m sure it’s not.I hope these ramblings are helpful to someone. Thank you. 🙏', 'It\\'s easy to see why these are so popular, and why they\\'re not usually discounted. This travel tumbler does everything right, as far as I can tell.1. It keeps my coffee hot for four hours. That\\'s past the point where the coffee becomes rancid and undrinkable, so full marks.2. It\\'s cool to the touch even when the contents are boiling hot. Full marks.3. It fits perfectly and remains stable in the cup holder of my 2015 Subaru Forester, yet is still easily removable. Full marks.4. The lid is easy to attach and remove. It always secures completely, with no \"seems tight but really isn\\'t.\" It doesn\\'t leak in normal use (I include not overfilling it as a condition of \"normal\"). It\\'s easy to open and close the slider, and that doesn\\'t leak either. Full marks.5. The whole thing washes nicely in the dishwasher.6. The optional handle works really well, is comfortable and balanced, and stays on even though it\\'s just a pressure fit.So in my own use, it\\'s pretty much perfect. Except that it\\'s so expensive that I\\'m afraid to take it outside the car or my house. Maybe that just means I\\'ll be more careful with it.', 'The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Love the look of the mug/tumbler.  Kept my coffee hot for a 2-3 hours, which is good enough for my use.  The lid is made of clear plastic, so can’t expect super insulation.  Plus, the coffee doesn’t taste as good anyway after a couple hours, so it’s good enough for my use.I did see the complaints of the lid in the reviews before I bought it.  Liked the look of it and the brand so I decided to test it out for myself.First, the magnet is not very strong, which makes the usability smooth but doesn’t make a tight seal.Second, the slide sip cover is just hard plastic so it wouldn’t make a tight seal anyway.  So it ended up letting some coffee out not during my drive but after I walked with it fir a couple minutes.  See the picture.  Maybe I wasn’t too careful with it but I didn’t put it upside down or shook it intentionally.  Just normal carry.YETI claims it’s not leak-proof, and perhaps it was never designed to be - probably to ease the manufacturing process and cut cost. I understand that.However, this product could’ve been awesome if the lid has some sealing component to it and stronger magnet to keep it closed tight.Overall, though, it’s a good-looking mug that I’ll keep and enjoy using. I didn’t expect leak-proof so just took off 1 star as the lid still could be better given the YETI brand.', 'I am tired - SO TIRED - of tumbler mugs with complicated lids that are IMPOSSIBLE to clean. Let me just state outright that from that perspective alone, the \"magslider\" lid is a work of genius. There\\'s no spring, no latch, no hinge, no tiny crevasses or nooks. You can take the slider off whenever you want and clean underneath it, but otherwise it stays in place extremely well.The downside of the lid is that it\\'s not at all leakproof. It\\'s scarcely even dribble proof. No, what it\\'s really going to accomplish is that it keeps your drink from splashing out onto things when you hit a bump or jostle it accidentally. That\\'s fine - keep the thing upright - but if they ever make an iteration of this lid that holds up to being inverted without leaking I will spend whatever they charge.Now, as for the tumbler itself, it works as advertised. The vacuum insulation works amazingly well for cold drinks. Ice lingers for hours. Hot drinks? It does okay. I\\'ve had Thermos brand products that kept hot drinks piping for 24 hours, while the Yeti will manage a quarter of that. The weak link is really the lid - heat rises and the lid isn\\'t a full seal (as mentioned above). Heat can/will escape readily to the point where about 4 hours into my workday my once piping-hot coffee is now drink-ably warm. There are worse things, I suppose. Get this one mainly for cold drinks, but know it\\'s suitable for anything.The powder coating is very nice and unlike enameled tumblers it seems like it will last. It provides a nice amount of grip as well, being somewhat roughly textured. I\\'ve covered mine in some vinyl stickers for a bit of character, but you could probably get them laser etched as well (like the Yeti logo is on the side).All in all, the only regret I have is not stepping up to the 32oz size for $5 more.', 'I like it but it’s no more special than any other vacuum insulated tumber. I love the olive green color though. You’d think YETI would make a leak free lid, or at least the tiniest bit better than the lid without the magnet.Ok somehow a line of rust has shown up in my cup. I’ve had it for a very short period of time. I don’t know how this could have happened, i did try and scrub it out. ill need to exchange it 🙁', 'It’s everything I was looking for. It’s strong and has a good weight to it. Even with scalding hot coffee inside, you cannot feel the heat while holding the outside of the container. As some people mentioned it is not entirely spill proof, so if you hold it upside down with the slider closed, coffee will comeback out, but if you knock it over and pick it up quickly nothing comes out, and if you knock it over and don’t react fast enough, it will spill slowly enough to not ruin anything (as long as you clean up the drips right away).A tip for people who like to fill it to the top: If you think you may have filled it a little too much to put the lid on, have the slider on the lid closed when you put the lid on. If it’s slightly over full and the slider’s closed, coffee will bubble up through the slider a little bit but stay in the top of the lid. If it’s slightly over full and the slider’s open, coffee will shoot up a few feet into the air.Another tip: Be aware of how hot your coffee is before taking a sip. Especially when you’re used to feeling the temperature from the outside of a cup, the heat-proofness can lull you into a false sense of security, and then you can burn your mouth, so think before you sip fresh coffee.', \"Overall this is a very high quality product from Yeti. The construction overall is great keeps drinks cold or hot for the advertised amount of time with high quality vacuum sealed steel. The only Cons I would have is the mag slider doesn't seal for protection against leaks which would make this product top knotch. The price point overall is decent compared to the quality Tumblr that you are getting.\", 'I\\'m not a Yeti snob, I have some RTIC stuff and find them comparable. I do however enjoy using my Yeti 18oz tumbler with chug top every day for water at work and after my Stanley vacuum pushbutton top thermos started leaking, I was in the market for a new coffee cup. My requirements are that it keeps coffee warm for 3-4 hours and doesn\\'t leak/spill coffee from the top. I don\\'t intend on throwing my thermos/cups in a bag and letting them turn upside down, but I need them to not leak when transporting to work and driving around. Well, this MagSlider lid really isn\\'t a good design. It\\'s a cool concept and makes for easy washing but it leaks like crazy. I understand it is advertised as \"slosh proof\" and not \"leak proof\", but even a gentle sloshing around spills coffee out of the top as if that mag slider lid wasn\\'t even there! It made a huge mess when I tried using it so unfortunately I had to return it. It also didn\\'t keep my coffee warm for longer than 2 hours. I did however place an order for another Yeti 18oz tumbler (which I assume is the same one I use for water), but with the hotshot cap which is advertised as leak proof. I\\'m hoping this will both keep my coffee warm for 3-4 hours and keep from leaking.', 'As I write this, I made a hot cup of coffee sometime ago, and it’s still hot. As for being leakproof, it doesn’t leak around the lip of the cup, but small amounts will spill out the mouth of the slider lid if chipped back at extreme angles. However, with ordinary use and carrying, it will not spell, however, I wouldn’t recommend throwing it in a bag with electronics, unless you get the rambleAs I write this, I made a hot cup of coffee sometime ago, and it’s still hot.

However, with ordinary use and carrying, it will not spell, however, I wouldn’t recommend throwing it in a bag with electronics, unless you get the Rambler bottle.  As for being dishwasher safe, I don’t know yet. Up to this point, I’ve always heated the warning not to wash stainless steel drinkware in the dishwasher, although I never really understood why.  but after verifying that this is indeed a genuine yeti, I’m currently doing the temperature test, and so far, it really is holding its own. r', 'This Rambler by Yeti is the best of its kind on the market! I have two of these 20oz Ramblers and they have yet to disappoint me. Hot drinks will stay hot for the first few hours while at hour 12 it’s still relatively warm. I’m not sure how long the cold drink accurately stays cold for because I down my cold drinks. The longest I had one for was 4 hours. It was still ice cold when I drank it and none of the ice melted (it was a hot day while driving). If you’re looking for a tumbler to keep your drinks hot or cold for hours on end, look no further than Yeti.', 'It\\'s a fine insulated cup.First, the good:Materials appear to be of the advertised quality.The polycarbonate lid is crystal clear, glossy, and beautiful.The lid fits tightly.The sliding magnetic drinking hole cover has a tactilely pleasant action.The sliding cover, cleverly, has hidden air displacement porting that closes when the cover is closed. It keeps the lid clean-looking and presumably reduces leakage when the lid is closed.The lid\\'s mold lines are thoughtfully laid out so that they do not interfere with the lens-like main window into the cup.It has a pleasant weight and fits comfortably in my hand. The powder coat provides adequate grip and is pleasant to touch.The replacable gasket seats on the sidewall of the lid rather than in a place where it could get pinched and leak. The gasket also has a double seal.And the could-be-better or disappointing:The \"canyon red\" is closer to a tomato red than the highly saturated and contrast-adjusted product photo suggests. I was expecting this cup to visually pop. I\\'d buy a different color given the chance.The steel is not as lustrous and smooth looking as it appears in product photos. It\\'s duller, with a coarse brushed finish.The steel near the rolled top of the cup has some marring, though it isn\\'t as noticable with the lid on.The top edge of the powder coating is noticably uneven.My tumbler came with a tiny piece of debris in the powder coat.Other notes:The sliding drinking-hole cover doesn\\'t perfectly mate to the edge of the lid. There is a small but visible gap when the lid is closed, and the lid will leak if tipped over while closed. This may have been an intentional design choice to allow venting of vapor so the lid doesn\\'t explode off when the container is full of hot liquid and shaken.Mine arrived with a small ding in the steel base. I\\'m not counting this against it, because I expect it\\'ll get even more dinged up and survive, but if you\\'re obsessive you might care.Overall, it\\'s a high quality and thoughtfully designed insulated tumbler, but I was disappointed with some of the details that in my opinion didn\\'t live up to the hype. I would buy it again.', 'This was our first Yeti purchase and is incredible.  I’ve used it everyday for three years and it’s made every other coffee thermos useless.  As you can see from the pictures, the mug itself still looks brand new.  The lid is slightly worn from daily hand washing, but still performs great.Pros:- Simple, 4-piece design.  You can clean it most days in less than a minute.  The mag slider pops off easily during cleaning.  We use the magnet feature store our lids against the sides of our stainless drying rack so we know exactly where to find it the next morning.- Heat!  With the slider closed, this keeps coffee hot for hours.  Even after 7-8 hours the coffee is still very warm.- Performance.  This fits in car cup holders perfectly, and is easy to grasp.  The black metal sides are grippable.  The slider prevents liquid from leaking out when walking or transferring.  It’s not “leak proof” but did hold 99% of the liquid the few times it was dropped or tipped over.  The slide makes it very easy to drink and re-seal, and I wouldn’t want the daily use of something required to be “leak-proof.”Cons:- The rubber o-ring seal around the lid is the only design flaw.  It traps coffee and moisture and needs to be cleaned at least monthly.  That area gets gross and you can see it build up through the clear lid.  I clean it by carefully using a butter knife to pry it out and then scrubbing the seal and the lid.  I’m not deducting the review because I don’t have any ideas on how to do this better, and haven’t found another, better option.Buy this and you won’t be disappointed.  We give them as gifts to family who love hot coffee.', 'I ordered mine from YETI Authorized and it was an authentic product and I was able to easily register it through the official YETI site. I see some complaining that they received a bootleg item, YETI says on their site in the faq section that the only seller on Amazon that is authorized by them and covered by their warranty is the seller \"YETI Authorized\", so if you plan on buying on here, you should definitely should take that into consideration.Overall, I\\'m very happy with my purchase. Was looking to upgrade to a better travel coffee mug. I previously had a ceramic one with a silicone cover, and it wasn\\'t ideal for me. I like this one a lot because it\\'s made of stainless steel & has a double chamber, which keeps the contents hot/cold, but still stays the same temp outside where you hold it, so your hands won\\'t even feel the difference. Really does help at keeping the contents the right temp, I had a hot cup of coffee and it stood hot the entire time I drank it & continued to fill it, over the span of several hours.I really like the lid with the mag slide. The lid, itself, doesn\\'t leak any, though the mag slide (the cover that goes over the drinking hole) does leak just a tiny bit while it\\'s closed, if tipped to the side, but I don\\'t plan on storing it in a bag or anything, anyway, so it doesn\\'t bother me. Still figured it was good for others to know in case they were looking for an entirely leak proof system.It\\'s very easy to clean & dries fast. I was surprised to find that the outside is painted stainless steel because, based on the photos, I thought it was going to be silicone coated, or something like that. So I was originally hesitant to buy white, because I thought coffee and dirt would stain it pretty fast, but now I can tell there shouldn\\'t be any issue with staining.I also purchased the straw lid to go with this and definitely plan on buying a few of these as gifts in the future!', 'We purchased this, not expecting it to be so large.  So, we are returning it - to the tune of $7.38, one third the cost of the article.  We would not recommend it due to size and definitely not happy about the shipping cost.  We are guessing that when having “Yeti” printed on the side drops as a fad, the company will do likewise.  Goodbye, Yeti.', \"This is absolutely a fake YETI - do not buy if you're looking for the real thing! I took it into the official YETI store when it showed odd color changes after the first time through the dishwasher. They identified it as a fake and held it up next to the real thing as a comparison (see photos - green is the fake). Even worse, the real ones are cheaper at $29.99. This may be a fine thermos, but it is NOT a YETI. If you're looking for the real thing, order directly through YETI.\", \"Bought a cheaper tumbler and it failed miserably. The lid was not working that good and it didn't seem to keep my water hot.  So the Yeti is engineered with superb functionality as well as quality.  I understand that this tumbler is not leak proof and actually that is better. The pressure that builds up from hot water can raise the lid, so with allowing just a little venting, the beverage stays hot and the lid stays on.Very pleased\", 'Ice cubes STILL in my drink the next day? Wow.I don’t rave about drink containers. At least I didn’t until Yeti came along.I thought it was all hype. You know, hipsters have to have the top brand, not because of function but status. And I figured Yeti for the outdoors was kinda like man-buns and bragging rights - why spend $10 when you can spend $30, right?Man, was that shallow, or what. What I found out was, in terms of Yeti, you pay for first class you get first class, and then some.I don’t care if it’s a camping ice box, drink container, or men’s hair berets - if it’s a Yeti, it’s the best. By far. (And, no, Yeti doesn’t make hair berets.)Everything pales in comparison to Yeti. I don’t know if they use Thanos level refrigeration technology or what, but if you want it warmer longer or colder longer and I mean WAY longer, Yeti is what you need.Period. End of story. Look no further. Yeti is IT.', 'I’m not gonna lie-I thought this was going to be a fraud as soon as I saw that the lid was clear plastic.  Don’t know a lot about heat transfer, but uninsulated clear plastic doesn’t seem to be the best material to choose while designing a cup that claims to keep my coffee hot all day. Well, I was wrong. It keeps my coffe hot all day! I just think I may have overfilled it-I had a little spill when I first used it. But not from the seal-it just drew some coffee over the seal when I put the lid on. I am really impressed!', \"There's a lot of reviews here claiming they received a fake, but I took a chance and I received the authentic Yeti Tumbler. I noticed that you can switch to buy from a different 3rd party seller through this amazon page and some of them are selling it below the manufacturer price of 29.99. That might be why they are getting fakes? Anyway, I got the navy blue yeti tumbler and it came with the mug slider. Couldn't be happier. I already have one at home and it keeps my beverage cold for hours even on a hot day, hence why I decided to get another.Note that mug slider lids are spill resistant and not spill proof, which is clearly mentioned on the packaging. On their website, Yeti also points out in a video that the mug slider will still have spillage if you tip it upside down, it only prevents side way spills by covering the lid, it is not a spill proof lid.\", 'I love the size of yeti cups I didn’t have this color keep in mind though it is very light pink . I have read the comments about the yeti cups being fake ....not true these are 100% authentic yeti cups. As you can see in my picture I have quite a few I’m a big fan of these types of cups because they’re just the right size and I like lids on my cups also a couple of these came from Dick’s Sporting Goodsso do not be afraid to buy these cups these are 100% yeti cups. If you own yeti cups then expect the quality of the brand. Great by the pink ice is the new favorite.', \"Just purchased this so I'd have a smaller size insulated tumbler.  I have two much bigger ones from a lesser known brand at a big box store.  After using this for a few days, I think it's safe to say that the Yeti and the off-label brand do an equally good job at retaining ice and keeping things cold.  I really don't notice a difference.  However, the top on the Yeti is superior and is far better and preventing leaks.  Better seal, better slide back opening.However, my 32oz tumbler from an off label brand was under $10.Although Yeti created this market....they no longer own it.\", \"Wife used this for the first time and it leaked.  Never really thought about reading the 1 star reviews on a YETI product, I've had good experiences with them.  But from what the others are saying on 1 stars is this product leaks... often.  Now there may be a manufacturing issue in only SOME of these, who knows.  But all I know is the one we bought for the wife leaks!\", 'Why don’t they make a slender one that many women would like? The most slender one seems like it’s for a man.  It weighs a ton.  I would also like a slick surface in truly pretty colors. Returned it.', \"I've been using it every day since I've purchased it. Your liquid stays cold for over an hour. It's really nice since I work on the computer it makes me drink a lot more water throughout the day. I love the lid and magnet slider, it's super easy to use and easy to clean. This is my first Yeti product, but not my last!\", 'Pros:1. Superior materials quality, build quality, fit and finish. This cup screams quality and durability.2. Fits easily into my vehicle’s cup holder.3. Very good (but not great) heat retention.Cons:1. Not a great value proposition at 30 bucks.2. Heat retention is very good as stated above. However, I have travel tumblers from Thermos, Contigo and RTIC that ALL equal or outperform the Yeti when it comes to keeping coffee HOT (the Contigo and RTIC are equal to the Yeti with the Thermos blowing them all away by a Country Mile).3. The Mag-Slide lid is not leak or drip proof. And while I give Yeti credit for advising the customer of that fact, it is still a disappointment at this price point. The cup won’t splash and leave you covered in coffee no matter what happens. But it will leak when hitting a bump in the road during your morning commute and drip if turned upside down. None of the other brands I mentioned previously have that problem.  And all are significantly cheaper to purchase than the Yeti tumbler.', \"I received this Saturday directly from YETI as it was labeled on the shipping label return address. Came brand new with a magslider lid and YETI registration documents. I believe some on here are fake, just make sure to select the right color and provider. I purchased the all black. Threw it in the dishwasher and used it today for coffee and water. No issues, hot is hot, cold is cold. Exactly what I wanted. Also, perfectly fits my cup holder, not sure why some reviewers say it doesn't? I have a standard 3series BMW with normal cupholder, no issues.\", 'I’ve been using the same hydro flask bottle for years, and finally decided to upgrade it. My first YETI product, which I was very excited about. But my first experience turned into a little bit of frustration this morning. Because the cup is licking. Is it normal? Or was it a fake bottle?For anyone who values to have their drink securely held - probably not the best choice.But if you are not traveling too much or planning to use it at home or just to let it sit in the car- should be alright.Other than that it keeps the drink hot, and I love the design and material. Wish my experience would turn out better.Thinking to return it, as I already have 2 Starbucks mugs that are licking ..', 'Love the cup, but it says my registration code is already in use...which makes me wonder it my cup is actually a yeti. This also prohibits me from getting a sticker pack...', 'Good quality.  Works great and keeps my coffee hot.  It is about 20% over priced in my opinion.', \"I bought this for taking coffee to work and for making coffee at work. For those purposes this works great. It keeps my coffee warm for a long time and when I use it for ice water it keeps the water nice and cool. I rated this product lower based on the retailer, I was sent a cup with a tiny rust stain at the bottom. I washed the cup and used it before noticing.I also bought the handle and I enjoy using this cup with that handle.For use and function I give the Rambler an AFor Yeti who sent me a defective product, I give them a 'D', the least they could have done is discounted the product.\", 'The lid is not leak proof, on either of the 2 tumblers (diff colors) I ordered. I ensured I had it closed properly (and all the way) and when it is barely tipped my coffee almost pours out, let alone my husbands who has his in his work truck that bounces all over, he was surprised to find a small puddle in his cup holder. Very disappointed with the lid, the cup itself seems sturdy and durable, but the lid is terrible and not worth to hold our coffee. Maybe it is better for something else.', 'I bought a 30oz tumbler maybe a year ago and love it.  I drink everything out of it and no longer use any of the large number of Tervis tumblers I\\'ve accumulated over the years.  I bought my wife a 20oz one on Amazon (Official Yeti Amazon aothorized storefront July 16th.  We noticed the first time using it that it didn\\'t seem to have the same quality of lid seal as mine.  We thought maybe after some use/washing it may \"work in\" or maybe just that size/model had different engineering/tolerance.  Either way it wasn\\'t a huge deal.  It doesn\\'t leak under normal use, except if turned up when it\\'s nearly empty.  But 100%, you can still put any liquid in mine after hundreds of uses, put the lid on it and turn it upside down and not a drop would leak, even completely full.  I recently bought a 20oz tumbler myself, from the same seller, and the lid is perfectly sealed and won\\'t leak or dislodge unless it\\'s dropped from a decent height, and even then it usually stays on.  I was wanting to get an exchange for my wife\\'s but I now find out that Amazon\\'s 30 day return window has passed, and because I didn\\'t get it on Yeti.com, I can\\'t exchange it there either.  It won\\'t keep me from buying them in the future, but rest assured if I have a problem at all, it\\'s getting returned.  Tervis at least has a lifetime warranty, despite otherwise being a subpar product.Edit:Not long after I ended up ordering a replacement lid, I did some more investigating and found that it was not the lid, but in fact the mug itself that was to blame.  I found this out by swapping lids with my own and it still leaked.  I also put this lid from the \"faulty\" mug on mine and it worked fine.  I examined the physical characteristics of each mug to look for defects/damage, and found that there is a small difference in engineering specs between the two.  I thought maybe one was a knock off, but I ordered them both from the authorized Amazon storefront and the lids work identically well on mine (no leaks, NEARLY leak proof but you basically had to drop it from waist high on a hard surface to jostle it).  Also, the manufacturer\\'s inscriptions are identical except for a number which I assume is like a serial number or batch number.  The \"faulty\" mug actually still had the QR code sticker on the bottom which seemed pretty legit (opened to yeti.com to register product.  Anyhow, in reading a bunch of poor reviews I\\'m beginning to think I stumbled upon something here.  Properly engineered/manufactured yeti ramblers work very well and are nearly leak proof.  BUT...if you get one of these \"bad batches\" or maybe it\\'s just a mismatched lid, then your experience might not be the same.  I did end up calling Yeti support since my purchase here was past 30 days, and after explaining the issue, it seems that they are going to take care of the issue, I just need to send them pictures of the rambler.  I\\'ll update if they end up not honoring that.  In the picture, the white one is the one that leaked with two different lids.  The red one is rock solid with either lid.  Notice the difference in how thick the stainless steel part is.  It\\'s subtle, and probably not the actual cause of the leaking problem, but indicates that there is a difference between the two.', 'My father used a certain travel mug for years I’d gotten him in Canada. I’d managed to get him a couple of replacements but eventually you couldn’t get them anymore… tragedy. Thus began the hunt for a new travel mug. With each contender we discovered new traits that were desirable/undesirable. Apparently for my dad a lot of it is in the lid. The mechanism which covers the opening has to be easy to open (check), and the opening itself must allow for a good but controllable amount of coffee to be poured into ones mouth (check, check).My dad doesn’t much care that it keeps the coffee very warm. He wants it to cool slightly so he can drink it all on his drive to work, then it stays in the car. But it does stay warm and once the lid is on, that lid is on. Anyone with difficulty with their hands might have trouble with the lid and find a screw on/off type better.If I need a new travel mug this is likely what I’ll get myself. I’d certainly recommend it.', 'This tumbler feels and looks nice (I was a bit disappointed in the color), and it it does a pretty good job of keeping my coffee hot. It does not, however, live up to all the hype I\\'ve heard about how long it keeps drinks hot. While it does keep my coffee hot longer than some other insulated tumblers that I\\'ve used, it\\'s not effective enough to justify the extra cost. I\\'m sure there are tumblers that are just as effective at two thirds the cost.Regarding the color, I admit that it\\'s not far off from the color rendered by my monitor in the item description. But I had hoped for something a little more vibrant. It would have been more accurate to describe this item as being \"tarnished copper\" in color, rather than copper. (This did not effect the rating that I gave it.)', 'It’s a good product.  My hot tea stays pretty hot for up to 6 hours, if the lid is entirely closed most of that time.  Drinks stay hotter in a cheaper Thermos brand cup, but the Yeti is more comfortable to hold and drink from than the Thermos.  I’d say this brand is just slightly overrated, but definitely a solid product and I recommend you try it out.  I’m not sure how it keeps cold drinks, because I haven’t tried that yet.', \"The color is exactly like the photo. The tumbler keeps my coffee hot, even down to the very last bit of it. It's sturdy, I've dropped it a few times in the short period that I've had it (I am a little clumsy at times!) and there's no dents, etc. So far, I am really pleased and I use it every day.\", 'I have two of these mugs and they both leak. This was very disappointing. It seems that whenever the mug is tipped a little or the liquid splashes around (when walking with it) it spills through the mouthpiece. If it tips over it WILL SPILL and make a mess. Do not buy this if you have a fast-paced or on-the-go lifestyle. There will be too much leaking for you to deal with.On the other hand, it keeps beverages hot for a long time and is SUPER easy to clean. The mouthpiece is magnetic and you can easily remove it for a wash. This is a fairly good to-go mug, but the leaking is definitely a big inconvenience.', 'Listen. I am one of those people who are late to the party. I didn’t read Harry Potter until book 7 was being released, I just started eating GoT.... and I just got my first Yeti. And it has changed my life.  I am usually guilty of making coffee, and needing to set it down somewhere (because kids etc.) and forget to go back to it. When I do finally make it back to it, it’s ice cold and I tend to nuke it a few times before I get tired of that process and just dump whatever coffee is left down the drain.I DONT HAVE TO DO THAT WITH MY YETI.I repeat. It has changed my life. My coffee that I pour at 7am STAYS HOT well after 2pm The. Same. Day. *boom* mind blown. Get one if you don’t have one.', \"I really, really dislike cups of tea I can't drink. And that's been a long-standing problem for me. My tea seemed to switch between scalding and stone cold so quickly that I either missed the drinkable window entirely or felt like I had to gulp it instead of savoring it. Most mugs were so small that I had to dance this dance multiple times a day, too, each time with the mug burning my hands. No drink should be this difficult to enjoy!I decided to switch to a Yeti Rambler to fix all that. I picked up this cup, along with the the Yoassi 18/8 Stainless Steel Tea Infuser Basket, and now brew my tea directly in the Rambler. I love love love my tea the way I've wanted to all along!I place the infuser basket inside the cup so the handles rest securely on the rim, add enough tea for 3 cups (about 1 tbsp of loose leaves), then add water and brew. Once the steep is over I remove the basket, add any sweetener, and done!With the Yeti being so well insulated, I do have to add 3 ice cubes to my tea between brewing and sipping to cool it down to a drinkable temp. Otherwise I have to leave the lid off for 30-45 mins. Once it's cooled off enough, though, I pop the lid on and maintain that temp for hours. (Those who add milk to their tea - which I don't - might be able to use that instead of ice to reduce the temp instead.) It doesn't burn my hands, either!  And since I'm basically brewing 3 cups at a time, I get to enjoy more for longer with fewer interruptions.On an aesthetic level I love how my Rambler fits in my hands, how my tea cup DOESN'T burn me when I'm holding it, how nice the texture feels, the weight... It really is wonderfully made. I also like how my infuser basket matches the steel trim on the edges, and how it looks with a reusable steel straw on the rare instances I want a cold drink.Honestly, my Yeti is now my favorite office accessory. Excellent purchase all around - highly recommended!\", \"So happy with this purchase! Reading other reviews got me a little bit nervous about the quality and authenticity of this cup, but I am completely satisfied! Arrived as described with the magslider lids, appears to be a genuine Yeti product. I fill up the cup every night before bed, and usually have ice cubes remaining in the morning. I have definitely been drinking more water since I have this handy cup, and well it fits well in the cupholders of my car (Toyota Highlander), it doesn't fit securely in the cupholders in my partner's car (BMW 3 series). Overall a great purchase and highly recommend!\", 'I loved this cup! I have one in the 30 oz so was super excited to get the blue in 20 oz. I received it on 9/17/17 and it appeared great and worked wonderful.  Sadly the bottom is already broken off and has a sharp crack through it. Very disappointed. :(', 'Product has standard Yeti quality. Unfortunately, designed in Texas, made in China is no longer good enough. Yeti charges enough for their products that they can afford to bring their manufacturing home. This is the last Made in China Yeti product I will buy. I can buy Chinese made equipment from the budget brands, but I’d rather buy American made products from Yeti.', \"What you need to know about these are that, if you keep the lid sealed, your drink will stay warm (or Cold) literally  from morning until night. I hate luke warm coffee so bought my first Yeti. Loved it, so bought a second for my water and then a third (for coffee for second location). If you put ice in with the drink, it actually gets COLDER throughout the day. Then bought one for  my wife and another for my daughter. Do I need to say more?  Only complaint is that while there are many great colors to select from, the pricing is different  depending on the color. Don't know why that is and it is a bit of a turn off but if you can get the color you want at a price you are wiling to pay, its a great product to have.\", 'The top is absolutely not the quality I would expect for such a hyped and expensive product. Basically, if you’re a commuter like I am and take the train so have to walk (sometimes quickly to catch a train!) it will spill from the top vent hole (even when the slider lid cover is closed). To top it off, it doesn’t keep beverages hot for more than a couple of hours. If you want something that keeps your coffee hot and won’t get all over your freshly laundered workwear, go with the Contigo West Loop or something like that.  Lastly, this thing scratches pretty quickly. I used mine once and placed it in my work bag (not touching other metal things) and my car cup holder and it already got a scratch! So disappointed.', \"GOOD: Heavy duty materials. Sturdy design. Good weight. Cold stuff stays cold.SO-SO: The clear plastic lid and magnetic slider aren't great. The slider mechanism does leak pretty bad just from a slight tilt. Hot coffee doesn't stay hot nearly as long as my good old Starbucks metal travel mugs. I suspect it has to do with the type of material used in the lid. Also, the bottom of the mug is bare metal and is slippery... too slippery.WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED?A better lid and slider mechanism for sure. It has to keep the hot stuff hot.A rubberized grippy disc on the bottom, again similar to many of the Starbucks metal travel mugs. That little touch makes a huge difference.So the mugs (I bought two) are okay... not as robust as I expected from Yeti.\", \"First off:There is NOTHING WRONG with these Yeti products!!!!!Over the years, I've used all types of travel tumblers: Thermos, Brookstone, Nissan Stainless -and whatever else.These Yeti products are everything they're cracked up to be.  In short, they're the best.I don't know what the beef is with the other product reviewers, because my 20 oz. Yeti Rambler is heavy duty, authentic, classy...and worth the $29.99 price I forked over for it.I got the:20 oz YETI Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler w/MagSlider Lid – in the classic seafoam color.While I was at it, I also sprang the $8.58 for the:ZYTC Handle for 20OZ Tumbler,Yeti Rambler Handle Anti Slip Travel Mug Grip BPA Free Cup Holder for Yeti Rambler,Rtic,Ozark Trail,Sic and More Tumbler Mugs. I mean, If you're going to treat yourself to the extravagance of a thirty buck mug, you may as well shoot the works and get the proper handle.I've wanted a YETI for a long time, but the negative reviews warning that these were nothing more than cheap and cheesy knockoffs scared me away.I finally decided to go for it, and I'm glad I did.Hey,I respect the time and effort people put into their product reviews, and I pay close attention to what they've got to say.However, in this case, whatever negative experiences they had, seem to have been addressed.  If you're like me, and you're on the fence about popping for one of these - and you've got a wad of cash burning a hole in your pocket – GO FOR IT!\", 'So this product originally came without the magnetic lid part.I contacted customer support and the magnetic part was shipped to me free of charge.Unfortunately, said magnetic lid still leaks. If you tip your cup so the liquid is against the mouth part, it\\'s going to leak for sure. I originally bought this because I wanted a leak-proof tumbler, and this unfortunately does not meet the standards.The cup itself is designed well -- it is very wide, so it will hold a lot of liquid for its height, and the textured outside walls are comfortable to hold. The wideness of the cup lets me wash the interior of the cup without needing a bottle scrubber.The temperature-holding aspect of the cup seems ~okay~. It\\'s not as good at holding temperature as my other thermos, but it\\'s not bad for a cup I\\'ll sip throughout the morning (hot tea cooled to \"warm\" after about 3.5 hours).The plastic lid part is easy to remove from the cup because there\\'s a small tab to pull.I imagine that the lid being plastic allows temperature to change more easily, though.Overall, I\\'d say that you can\\'t really use it as a replacement for a thermos; it\\'d basically only be able to replace a cup.--- ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW ---This cup was advertised as having a fancy lid with a patented magnetic lock.Unfortunately, it appears as if I don\\'t get to experience it, as my lid came without said magnetic lock.', 'This product leaks badly , and is big to hold if you have small hands.  Did not keep coffee hot either - I returned the product.  THis is what they told me about that product, that is clearly not indicated anywhere in the description : The MagSlider Lid is not leak-proof, but is splash resistant. The YETI Rambler tumbler is designed for a press fit lid interface and cannot be leak-proof. The YETI Rambler bottles, with their threaded interface, are the leak-proof solution. Check out the new YETI Rambler 12 oz Bottle with Hot Shot Cap for the best to offer in leak-proof heat retention.You may notice that our MagSlider Lid resists spills and splashes with cold drinks better than hot beverages. This has to do with water viscosity as cold liquids have a higher viscosity than hot liquids. Cold drinks do not move or flow as fast.Hope this helps the next person when looking for a new mug!', 'I needed a travel cup that could fit in my truck\\'s cup holders and keep my coffee super hot for at least 4 hours. This cup does all of that. In fact, it keeps my coffee piping hot for about 6 hours before it begins to cool. However, I had to knock a star off my review because it does not hold 20 ounces if you want to put the lid on it. You know, which is the whole point of a travel cup.I am one of those coffee snobs who must have my coffee exactly how I like it every time. That\\'s why I make my own. And I use precise measurements to do so. I look like a mad scientist in the mornings with measuring cups and shot glasses and everything weighed out. My old travel mug (Bubba) was also a \"20-ounce\" mug and held exactly 20 ounces and let the lid pop on. This one, holds 16 ounces max.Now, it can HOLD 20 ounces, but the lid is slightly depressed into the cup itself, which forces scalding coffee up through the mouth hole. Ouch.Still, it\\'s a great cup and keeps my coffee hotter than any other travel mug I\\'ve tried. I just really wish I could get my full 20 ounces and still use the darn lid.', 'After gifting 2 Yeti tumblers to friends for Christmas, I finally gifted myself one after Christmas.  They loved them and everyone I know who is a coffee/tea drinker has one or wants one.  The good news is that the tumbler is great:  it is well made, it keeps my coffee hot, it’s easy to hold and it’s easy to clean.  The bad news is that the MagSlider lid that comes with it allows leaks and spills when it is moved or carried.  As I’m walking to my car with a full tumbler of coffee, slider closed, it leaks out of the top and onto my hand.  It has leaked into my lunch tote as I carry it into work and splashed out of my car cup holder when the car is moving or braking.  When it was gently knocked over with the lid intact and the slider closed (my lunch tote slipped sideways on my desk) the coffee poured out of it onto everything. It’s maddening.I’m baffled that Yeti, which is such a popular and trusted brand, could get a tumbler so right and a lid so wrong.  I haven’t found any Yeti brand alternative/replacement lids that are leakproof/spill-proof, but I really like my Yeti tumbler and I actually want to take it with me wherever I go, so I searched (and searched) and found some lids that work with it.  They are DSCVR 2-piece Enhanced Tumbler Replacement Lids, (currently $9.99 for 2) which claim to be “spill-proof, shatter resistant, perfect fit...for Yeti Rambler...20oz.” They are clear lids with snap closed latches and the latch colors are black, pink or blue and they also sell them for the 30oz tumblers.  So far, these have worked out really well and have stopped all of the leakage from my Yeti tumbler.', 'If for some reason you pour your coffee in this tumbler, walk to your kitchen table and sit there the entire time to drink your coffee, it\\'s great! But if you take this in your car to get or work or anywhere else, it leaks so bad. It leaks through the top part of the lid that you slide open and closed. I had \"high hopes\" for buying the Yeti brand and I literally got burned (by my coffee that poured out of the closed lid). It\\'s not a small leak either, the liquid comes though at ease and literally gets everywhere. I know Yeti seems like the cool legit brand here, but do not buy this. It\\'s cheap very poorly made.', 'I was looking for a sturdy yet stylish mug that was better than the ones from the big box stores but wasn\\'t too expensive if I lost it or banged it up.  This Yeti mug fit the bill.  The materials feel solid and well put together.  It is easy to clean and looks good.  I only have two small gripes.  One is that it\\'s a bit too \"fat\" so at times it\\'s a bit difficult to hold, but that\\'s more because I have small hands.  The other is that the lid does allow quite a bit of heat to escape from the mug, but I knew that before I purchased as the lid is not designed to be completely tight.  I like the magnet slider on the lid that keeps it securely closed.  I\\'m enjoying my morning coffees a bit more because of the Yeti mug.', 'I am not a person into designer labels, big names, etc. but I love this tumbler.  I can see why this brand is superior to the \"knock-off\" brands.  First of all, it doesn\\'t have any interior seams. Second, it is dishwasher safe. Third, it comes with a serial number that is registered with the manufacturer and has a 5 year warranty.  The lid is extremely easy to open and close with the flip of a thumb - essential if you\\'re going to use this for driving.  Note:  If you drop the lid and the slider comes off, it is NOT broken.  The slider is magnetic, just pop it back on.  I am extremely pleased!', 'I love burning the roof of my mouth when I get a good swallow 2 or 3 hours after filling my cup. Really, what more can you ask for than the chance to scald yourself with your hot, caffeinated beverage of choice? These are great tumblers! My kingdom for ones that you can throw in the dishwasher, but in the meantime....', 'This is a big heavy thermos. Kept my coffee hot in 20-degree weather for the hour I walked my dog today as it should. Be prepared though, it is large & requires big hands to hold well, my wife thought she wanted one until she grabbed it. They do have an optional handle for it, but is that what you really want?I\\'m not sure it will do what they say keeping things hot & cold, and the top may leak slightly, but it\\'s not much before stopping and they say it does in the add!This thing kind of reminds me of my old Thermos I carried with my lunch to work which was cheaper. The price is too high in my opinion, but I\\'ll use it as I\\'m outside a lot.I got the green one and the color is good, it does seem to be made well.----------------UPDATE 1-11-2022--------------------Don\\'t waste you\\'re money!! This thermos cup is way overrated, and extremely overpriced!I was in the woods cutting big timber today and left this in the truck for about 2-hours with piping hot coffee. When I took a break I was really looking forward to a cup of coffee, SADLY it was less than luke-warm. Temp had been about 28 degrees and the sun was out bright. \"Very Disappointing\" This is not the first time it\\'s happened and it\\'s really sad this thing is that bad!My wife has a cheap $8 one she got a Marshalls that keeps drinks cold & hot most of the day!\"\"I DO NOT recommend the Yeti Rambler\"\"', 'I am so annoyed, this rambler was more expensive than other brands and it isn’t even leakproof. THIS THING LEAKED ALL OVER MY BAG and nearly ruined my computer! Do NOT buy this crap. I am so pissed off and disappointed. What an absolute waste of money!', 'The Yeti is a nice-looking vacuum insulated tumbler that will keep your coffee warm to hot.Easy to clean too.However, if not kept completely level, you\\'ll have coffee flying hither and yon. This tumbler might be fine sitting in a cupholder in your car, but if you need a tumbler to put in the water bottle sleeve of your EDC, or want to walk/hike move around with this in your hand, you\\'re going to get the flying coffee treatment, or worse, splash it on someone nearby.A poor choice compared to my old Contigo Autoseal West Loop. I cannot recommend the Yeti, regardless of all the marketing and meaningless \"cool factor\" hype. Buy a Contigo. Fits in your hand, doesn\\'t spill. Ever. Lay a Contigo full of hot coffee sideways in your pack and you\\'ll find it didn\\'t leak a single drop.', \"I just bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it! She has recently resumed going back into the office and has been taking coffee from home. This has worked out fantastic for her. It keeps coffee hot for hours, and tastes great!She filled it at 7:30 in the morning, and it was still HOT after 11 AM.  The coffee also tasted great in it.She was using a plastic cup from a national bagel chain.  That mug didn't keep the coffee hot nearly as long, and the coffee didn't taste good in that mug.I was amazed at how excited and happy she was with a thermal tumbler, but she was.The Yeti is a bit more costly than other options, but most definitely worth it.  You get what you pay for in this case.  The mug is made extremely well and rugged and likely will last a very long time.  it works great. It fits in the vehicle cup holder.  The slide on the lid works great. It looks good.  I'm really not sure what else you could ask for in a product like this!\", 'Exactly what the title says. This sucks as a travel mug because the lid leaks!I thought my mug was defective and sent them an email about the lid leaking… not to mention the magnetic lid opening when I accidentally tipped the mug on its side. They sent me another lid and explained how their lid has small holes in the top to release pressure.Ok… but who wants a “travel” mug that leaks. If I walk from my doorstep to my car liquid will come up through the little vent holes and then if the mug tips just a little, the liquid spills… WTF!I had a $5 travel mug for 7 years that did not leak one drop until the seal started going on the lid. So I bought this Yeti travel mug thinking it would last a while and it leaks from day 1.I’ve spilt hot tea/coffee on my hands, my arm, my leg while wearing shorts, in my car, on my desk, and the final straw was a white t-shirt that had tea drops on it and stained.I like Yeti products, but NOT this leaky travel mug.', 'FALSE ADVERTISING1) Not stainless steel it\\'s actually aluminum.2) Stainless steel doesn\\'t stain or rust.3) Yeti is made of ALUMINUM which stains and rusts.4) Yeti\\'s warranty doesn\\'t cover rust.

First. It feels much lighter then the real cup. The letter etching on the side and bottom are give away a it’s fake.  The lid lettering is upside down too.

It’s a good knock off that I will be returning.', 'I\\'ve always wanted a Yeti but didn\\'t fully understand the hype quite honestly but now that I finally own one, I get it or I \"Yet it\" lol.  I primarily wanted mine for water consumption to help me fulfill my daily requirement and it does just that! I don\\'t know about you but I can only drink water when it\\'s freezing cold and this tumbler keeps it cold all day and into the night....in fact, you can\\'t even put too many ice cubes in it or you\\'ll be refilling the water all the time because the ice doesn\\'t melt.  I love that I can put it down anywhere and it doesn\\'t leave a mark on any surfaces (i.e., coffee tables, nightstand, etc.).  When I chose this particular Yeti tumbler, I was worried I wouldn\\'t get enough of a flow from the slide top spout on the lid when swigging so to speak (vs. a wide open top tumbler with a screw top) but it flows generously and I couldn\\'t be more pleased - I\\'m able to chug away!  I\\'m easily drinking 4-5 of these a day and I\\'m sure it\\'s just pure coincidence, but I even had perhaps the best set of lab results I\\'ve ever had at a recent physical after only a couple of weeks of using my new Yeti.  I totally attribute this to being as well hydrated as I was (gotta flush out those toxins haha).  I love my Yeti so much, my whole family has one now in different colors and the best part is, no rings on my furniture anymore from the kids leaving sweating water glasses all over the place!  If you\\'ve been struggling with spending the money on yourself like I was, struggle no more.  Go buy one - you won\\'t be disappointed!', 'YETI Rambler mugs were recommended by a friend to use in my car.  But what he didn\\'t tell me was that even the slightest \"tipping\" will cause my coffee to leak from the magnet-controlled sipping hole on the top.  So both of my mugs leaked in my backpack while walking to the garage to get my car.  Not so \"Swell\" to have a premium-priced mug that leaks en route to your final destination.  I gave one star because I had to, and another star because it\\'s a nice looking mug to display in my Mercedes-Benz cupholders. No more stars owing to the leaking sipping hole.  Not so \"Swell.\"', 'For starters, I am amazed by all of the reviews, complaining about the mag slider lids not being leak proof, when nowhere has it ever been advertised by YETI that the mag lids are meant for that...they\\'re splash resistant, not leak proof. They serve the purpose they are intended for, exactly as described by the manufacturer. If you want leak proof, there are lids available for that purpose...they screw on though and are not compatible with the 20 oz rambler. The 18 oz rambler and 26 oz rambler are the closest to this size with the screw on, leak proof lids. They\\'re called \"triple haul lids\" and are guaranteed 100% leakproof. There are warnings about temperatures for hot liquids and pressure buildup included with all original packaged YETI\\'s too, so reading the inserts that come with their products is important. The hubs and I both work route jobs live in SE Texas, often described as \"satan\\'s armpit\", due to the crazy heat and high humidity. We keep our 30 oz tumblers on us at all times while we work, filled with ice and water to keep our cores cooled down, bc we\\'re hot and sweating most of our work day and it takes a toll. I use my 20 oz rambler in the AM, so I can drink my coffee while I\\'m in the car doing school drop-off\\'s, so it doesn\\'t splash out everywhere (like it did, back when I used disposable travel mugs). It\\'s been awesome and in the time that I\\'ve owned it, it\\'s paid for itself several times over, compared to the $25 a month I used to spend on disposable coffee cups with lids.', 'I tried a number of different travel mugs, including those by corksicle, the beast and Tervis.  This is definitely made the best- I didn’t want to believe the hype but it’s true.  Yeti makes an outstanding product.  I especially like the magnetic cover thing for the lid.  Very easy to clean and has stayed nice and waterproof after months of using and dishwashers.  And keeps hot drinks piping hot- sometimes I have to leave the lid off for a few minutes so my coffee isn’t too hot but that’s probably just me.The only complaint is this model feels too big (wide) for my hand.  My hands are fairly Normal size too.  I still use it and have bought it for others (men with big hands actually).  Because of its size I would not buy for children, teenagers or anybody with small hands.  This sounds like a small issue-no pun intended- but it is a reality, at least for me.', 'From reading older reviews, it seems that at one time Amazon was (mistakenly) selling cheap knockoffs of this Yeti. This is NOT a knockoff and performs amazingly well as one would expect from this brand. It seems to keep cold drinks cold better than keeping hot drinks hot but does OK in that and excellent in the keep cold routing.', \"This is a  great mug for coffee.I have the seafoam 20 oz tumbler with the slider lid.The color is great and unlike other colored tumblers, this one DOESN'T STAIN when using it for coffee.I love the slider lid as well.  The mouth opening is perfect and the 'ledge' at the opening if very comfortable to drink from, if that makes sense.The smaller (non-slider type) lid opening is too small/narrow and it creates a 'vacuum' when you sip from it and so the drink doesn't come out very well (pretty annoying).Great tumbler, comfortable to hold, coffee stays hot for way long enough to finish the drink and then some.I've left it in my car while running errands in the winter (I'm in Illinois - I know, gross) and it was still hot and drinkable.Not sure what all of the one star reviews are for (that these are fake) but those were in 2017 and maybe back then it was true but I love this mug and would highly recommend it.Hope this helps.  :)\", \"I initially dismissed Yeti products as being high-priced elitist lifestyle creations.

I could put ice and soft drinks in the cup at dinner time and by bedtime the ice would have hardly melted. By morning there was still ice and the drink was still ice cold.The magnetic closure is the other great thing on this. Other drink closure valves are are a joke, always leaving a crack. The Yeti magnetic closure valve really works. I haven't turned it upside down, but in normal use, when the valve is closed, nothing at all splashes out.I liked it so much I got myself another one for home use and I got my son the higher capacity one.Highly recommended.\", 'This keeps beverages either hot or cold an incredible length of time. My coffee stays hot, I mean hot, for hours, up to 4 hours ( I tried this just to see how long it would stay hot). It keeps cold drinks really cold for many hours, and the ice inside does not melt. This is an incredibly good product and I recommend it. The mug material is of high quality; I chose black and it is stunning. I bought the 20 ounce and am buying the 30 ounce now.  The lid secures quite tightly to the body with a slight push and the slide tab is magnetic, making for long wear. I put the unit in the dishwasher and the underside of the top (which usually collects coffee) cleaned up perfectly. I am buying another one as this product is just really darn good.

It keeps my coffee hot for about 2 hours if using the lid that comes with it. The lid is easy to get on and off but still keeps the drink hot. It fits most car cup holders and fits my hands perfectly. It also has a matt, kind of rough surface so it doesn't easily slip out of my clumsy hands. My other insulated cup is almost too large and is heavy to pick up when it is full. The Yeti is easy to clean and stains don't seem to collect on the matt surface. I spray the inside with a bleach cleaning spray when coffee stains appear. It's easy to wash out. I don't mind that it's not advised to put it in the dishwasher.\", 'Funny how people complain about the lids leaking. People need to realize there\\'s no such thing as a perfect product and you are going to have trade offs when it comes to features. IF you approach this Yeti with realistic expectations, you\\'d be hard pressed to find an issue with it.PROs:- Removable magnetic closer is NEXT LEVEL. Again, it\\'s not water tight, but I would trade that for the convenience of cleaning any day.- Did I mention it\\'s dishwasher safe? Yeah. That\\'s a big freaking deal to me. You would not believe how many times my wife came home with a \"cute\", cheap, tumbler and it said \"hand wash only\". Never again. I bought 7 of these Yeti\\'s and tossed every other tumbler I owned. I don\\'t have time to hand wash anything.- Durability is top notch. I\\'ve had these for about 3 months now and use them every day. As a result, it\\'s not uncommon for these to run through a hot dishwasher cycle 4-5 times per week. The coatings have not shown any signs of wear. This is the point where all of my old \"hand wash only\" mugs would have been chipping and falling apart.- Did I mention the magnetic closure? LOVE these lids. The engineer behind these should have won a Nobel Tumbler Award.. if they had one.. I don\\'t know. Give that Guy or Gal a raise!- Fits in any car cupholder I\\'ve tried.CONs:- Not one con to mention. I don\\'t see the need for a leak proof design. If this were to fall over or be dropped in the car, you would have enough time to grab it before any real damage set in. The lid will leak but we\\'re talking drips. You will survive, this will save you in a pinch, your first world problems will continue to be just that...BUY this Tumblr. Don\\'t look back.

I personally have had the first YETI for almost two years and its holding up great-my husband uses it daily for work. I decided that it was time for me to purchase my own cup. I am not a person that likes color, so I was torn between the stainless steel, the black and the copper. I ended up going with the copper color and I am not disappointed. Its beautiful. I am most excited about not having to heat up my coffee 10 times before I finish it. By the way, the same color is available at the YETI website for $10 more.', 'I always wondered what the big deal about these “yeti mugs” was and now I know. Talk about a hot cup of coffee! I swear this mug increases the temperature with the lid fully closed. Mind blown when I go to take a sip 30 mins later and I almost burn my mouth!It fits in my car cupholder which is a must. It has an easy slide hole closure which is conveniently magnetic - so you can pop it off to clean or .... if you’re like me and drop your yeti rambler on the paved driveway, the lid mechanics won’t break or loosen, just pops off! You can put it back together in no time and forget all about that little whoops moment. Ha!The quality is awesome, I can tell I’m going to get my moneys worth over the years of use. I also like the large cup capacity & easy to secure lid.The only thing I don’t love is that the slider hole cover isn’t leak proof.  If you tip, bump, or jostle it quickly, liquid seeps out a bit into the lid. If it tipped over, it would leak slowly. Not a deal breaker whatsoever for me though, I wasn’t looking for a leakproof option.', 'Poor design. I bought this after getting a recommendation from a friend. I figured with a $30 price tag and great reviews that I would be happy with my purchase. It only took one use to convince me that this was a bad purchase.I put hot coffee into my 20oz yeti to take to work (not full, only about 15oz). On my way out of the door I noticed that, if I sightly topped the cup when the top was on tight and the sip spout closed, the coffee would bubble out of the spout. I expected that the cup would at least keep my drink inside while closed completely. I thought that maybe I hadn’t closed it all the way and tried again, but it was closed. Poor design for hot drinks. Maybe it’s better for cold drinks.I’ve already used it now, so I probably can’t return it to Amazon.', 'I\\'ve heard a lot of great thing about Yeti products, so when it was time to retire a Thermos brand travel mug I decided to give this a try. My first impression was that it looks and feels high quality. I really like the texture on the finish (I got a black one). It\\'s easy to grip and feels nice without being overly \"sandpaper-y\". I really like the magnetic slider on the lid. It is absolutely not leak-proof, but it does a good job of holding liquid back. If  you drop it or knock it over it will leak, but not nearly as much as if it were just a wide open hole.My only issue with the mug is how the insulation is advertised. It had a sticker on it that said it will keep your drinks \"as hot or cold as science allows\". I am well aware it\\'s marketing hype, but honestly it\\'s not nearly as good at insulating as the Thermos mug I replaced. Sure, it keeps hot stuff hot (I don\\'t use it for cold drinks) but I suspect that the plastic lid allows a great deal of heat to escape. It will keep a hot drink warm enough to enjoy for an hour or so before it starts to get room-temp. That\\'s good enough for me, but it\\'s not as impressive as I\\'ve experienced in the past.And for what it\\'s worth, mine appears to be a genuine Yeti product. I saw quite a few reviews talking about how they got a knock-off and something or other wasn\\'t authentic. Mine seems to be the real deal. It came with plenty of mini-brochure marketing crap and a sticker. Overall, it\\'s great and I really like it, but if you\\'re buying this mug to keep hot stuff \"as hot as science allows\", there\\'s probably a better mug out there.', \"This mug is built like a tank, looks great and I love love love the lid! No more unknown twisted lid gaskets to dribble coffee in my lap! The lid fits nice and snug and slides open smoothly and quietly when you want to take a sip. But that is where the love affair ends...this mug is HORRIBLE for keeping things hot. Lukewarm OK but hot...forget it. This mug falls somewhere in between my old leaky contigo and a ceramic mug. It's really that bad. And I preheat my mug and thermos with hot water before using. I can't speak to how it works on cold beverages tho..maybe that's where it shines. One more very positive note is that it cleans up great in the dishwasher..lots better than old mug. So I guess I will just have to drink my coffee a little faster. This mug would be worth the cost if it did a better job with hot stuff but I can't recommend it at this pricepoint for the performance.\", 'My fiancé wanted a Yeti to replace her badly dented Simple Modern brand tumbler. She, as was I, under the impression that this $50 Yeti would live up to the hype and be far superior. Her old tumbler has a straw through the very insulated lid, so I ordered the straw replacement lid for her yeti adding an additional $10 or $12. There is no type of gasket around the straw opening in the lid and the lid is not insulated at all. I know that it came with the slide opening lid, but that has no insulation either.Long story short, the Simple Modern brand tumbler has been left in the car for days at a time and still had ice in it. Left in the car in Chattanooga in August! The Yeti doesn’t keep ice overnight in the air conditioned house.The only redeemable thing about the tumbler is that I was able to get the exact color she wanted.The Yeti tumbler is definitely inferior to the Simple Modern tumbler…at nearly twice the price. I’m sure the neighbors would be impressed if we put the Yeti sticker on the car, but we were not at all impressed with this grossly overpriced, inferior product.', 'I really like Yeti products - however, they do take a very long time to mail and receive.  I found the color I wanted and I purchased through an alternative buy (product may be damaged).  I had found this color on eBay and ppl were asking ridiculous prices for this.  I received this item in less than 2 days and it was in PERFECT condition.  I was thrilled!!  It keeps my drinks hot or cold no matter what!  You can’t go wrong with the quality or the price!  Take a gamble on the alternative purchases - it has served me well and saved me A LOT of money!  Even if the yeti comes a little damaged - who cares - you’ll own it long enough that eventually it will receive a few dings throughout time.

So this was my first (and really only) choice when I decided I needed to upgrade my travel mug.  It\\'s a great size, it keeps my coffee hot for a long period of time, the blue color is lovely.  BUT...the lid on this thing is terrible.  I read the reviews that said \"not leakproof\" but this is ridiculous - liquid sloshes out with barely any movement.  This mug is only good if you plan to use it ONLY in one place (like a desk) where you won\\'t move at all.  It\\'s not good for the car, it\\'s not good for the subway, it\\'s not even good for walking around, let alone any more strenuous outdoor activities.  Rather disappointing, all in.', '[PREFACE]: I only use this for coffee. I love coffee and have picky preferences regarding how I like it.Aesthetics: great finish and sleek style.Functionality:• It keeps coffee hot for as long as it takes for me to drink. Even if it kept it hot for 4 hrs, it would not taste how I would want. That said, I would say for a solid hour I can go back to the mug and it will be a hot enough temperature for me to enjoy; will it stay warm longer- yes. • It fits in most cup holders. • I love the magnetic lid; however, it is not leak proof. I noticed that the magnet does not perfectly line up with the opening.Summary: It is definitely built solidly. There is a heft to it that other \"Yeti-like\" mugs don\\'t have. The powder coated paint job is a very nice touch- quality. While I have never had coffee pop out like other mugs, the magnetic lid could be an easy fix- it could line up better or there could be a rubber piece on the edge of the black slider. This would fill in gaps and make it spill-resistant (maybe not proof but you could drop it with almost nothing coming out. I have a sealed Starbucks mug. It was on clearance but it is a sealed metal double wall with a cool magnetic mechanism that pulls a rubber piece up when you twist the lid. The issue is that with a frothy latte it cuts off some of the delicious foam. BUT its spill proof. That allows my to put it in my backpack drink holder with no fears.The Yeti was my hope of a perfect mug. While it has the wider mouth opening to enjoy even lattes, the lack of spill proofing seems like a missed opportunity. I looked at the lid and in a few minutes deduced a solution so it feels like Yeti could do a little better for a premium mug. Other than that little gripe it is my favorite mug that I dont bring to school.', 'I had a YETI 20 oz. rambler cup for3 years that I LOVED, but, alas! I recently set it on top of my car and drove off. When I realized what I had done, I went back but some lucky person had already found it... That cup kept ice unmelted for over 8 hrs at work, or overnight on my bedside table.I missed it so much that I ordered a new cup. However, the replacement cup is no better than other non-Yeti insulated cups. The ice melts within an hour or so. Hot drinks cool off in about the same time. All this to say, I am wondering if I received an authentic YETI cup...or if I was sold a knock-off. I have other YETI products...including a coffee mug. None of these have proven to be so ineffective as the new 20 oz. Rambler. What to do, What to do? So disappointed in this latest purchase.', 'Yes,EntirelyTrulyINSULATED… lol.That’s what it should stand for. My hot, 8am coffee will still be hot by lunch at 1pm. Granted my coffee doesn’t make it past 8:15, but if work is busy there are times I just sip it throughout my morning and it’s still just as hot. As long as you keep the latch closed, of course. It’s also very leakproof because even as adults we arent any less prone to dropping things. So it’s nice to know that if it falls it will still be in tact. My job actually gifted us YETI mugs last Christmas and that’s when I was put on. I bought this mug for my brother because he wouldn’t stop using mine!! Lol. That’s how great it is.', \"In the last 15 months I have purchased (including gifts) 5 Yeti Colsters, 2 Yeti Ramblers in 30oz, 1 Yeti Rambler in 20oz and 1 Yeti Rambler 14oz mug.I purchase Yeti products for birthdays and christmas... and for ourselves at home. We have been using their 20oz Yeti Ramblers for about 3 years now. I had just had the basic silver color. I saw they were going to stop making the Yeti Colsters (the can koozies) and so I decided to get 2 to try out before they were gone for good (then saw they were just releasing a 2.0 version not getting rid of the colster product itself). Just one use is all it took to never go back to the fabric koozies you can find at grocery stores. We immediately bought 2 more Yeti Colsters to total 4. First time we got 2 basic silver ones, then 2nd time we picked colors out. I got white for my colster and decided a few weeks later that I loved the white that I needed a white 20oz Yeti Rambler for my everyday coffee too.We haven't encountered a problem with our yeti products. I recommend them to everyone who could benefit from the use of them and it's nice seeing a gift actually used after gifting it.\", '\"I like a travel tumbler that is not leak proof\" says No One Ever. It would behoove Yeti to spend their engineering dollars on making this item leak proof instead of fooling around with an unimpressive magnetic closure that leaks. I did notice in the product description that they never said the item was leak proof. However I am happy with the thermal performance and it keeps my coffee very hot for quite a while and I otherwise like the product. If I need to bang it around I fill it about three-quarters full and that helps. At least it doesn\\'t fill up the floor mat of my car if it tips over... there\\'s only a dribble. I\\'ll live with it. I like the materials it\\'s made from and that it fits where I need it to. Yeti could stand to review their engineering process for this item. Make customers happy.', 'Good:The takeaway I get from this product is it\\'s ability to keep things cold/hot. Although this is not revolutionary, it is a really nice amenity. It\\'s also nice to look at, I personally picked out the Navy blue color and it hold up really nice.Bad:Not too sure on this one. I\\'m gonna assume user-error but I also feel like for this price that user-error should be included? Anything that expands or contracts it just doesn\\'t like when closed. Which makes sense in the real world, thermodynamics and all, but for a product that boasts it\\'s temperature capabilities and leak-proof features I feel like it\\'s just not good enough. Any kind of soda will leak because of the fizz pressure, hot beverages will leak because of the steam pressure, cold beverages will leak (honestly idk why on this one, contraction maybe?). Either I received a bad product or the \"leak-proof\" has a very small window of uses.Verdict:Would highly recommend. What? lol yeah. Honestly I\\'m being a little harsh on it. It looks great, it feels of very high quality, the temperature of my drinks seems to be the same by the time I finish them. All in all it\\'s a very good product but for this price I feel like the lid could be slightly improved? I\\'m sure the engineering involved in this is already impressive but I feel as if a wide variety of drinks seems to be off the table. How often am I spilling things? Well, that\\'s not really the point. The point is IF I were to knock my mug over, I\\'d like to have complete confidence that the liquid held inside, stays inside.', 'I take it out with me daily and water stays cold all day in the car. Yesterday I dropped it 😬the top  flew off, the piece that closes it flew off and IT DID NOT BREAK 😁back together perfectly', \"I bought the all-stainless 20 ounce Yeti Rambler, and it is very nicely constructed, has a very good lid for sipping/drinking, and is incredibly easy to clean.  I use it only in the office, so do not care about any leakage.Two Big Negatives:  1) I am a tall man with medium hands, and this is a very big diameter mug to hold.  It should have been taller and thinner.  If you have smaller hands, I do not recommend this mug.  2)  It does not keep liquids nearly as hot as my Camelbak 20 ounce Chute or even the old Starbuck's/Contigo 16 ounce tumblers I have.  It is Okay if you want to drink everything within 30 minutes.Overall, I don't think it is worth the high price for this size Tumbler.\", \"I'm giving this product 4 stars for a variety of reasons.It has a clean streamlined appearance with nice wear-resistant color, and does keep my coffee warm for ~4-5 hours.I'm mainly disappointed by the fact I can't just pop it in my purse/cup holder and forget about it because if it tilts over to the point that the coffee is hitting the clear top, then the coffee can and will come out the drinking hole and therefore into my purse/cup holder. **It does not leak out the sides, the lid is very snugly fitted. I've combated this by just carrying the tumbler around separately and slightly underfilling it.I'm also disappointed because the streamlined appearance means it's not ergonomically shaped. It's very smooth so if your hands are dry and small, you have to be mindful of not dropping it as there's nothing to grab onto.I have actually dropped mine (just once) - the tumbler fell right on the asphalt, which actually brings me right back to positive features because the paint hardly chipped from falling ~4 feet. There are little gouges but no real major/obvious damage which is impressive, and ironically no coffee spilled. I picked it up quickly so I guess the coffee didn't have enough time to slowly leak out, but I was still pleasantly surprised.TL;DR this tumbler will keep your coffee warm for hours, looks nice and is durable, but will leak out the top if tilted for longer than 1.5 seconds.\", 'So I bought this mug at Christmas as a relative got one for a gift I liked the look and it seems really nice well it’s actually a good mag keep your drinks hot and cold just like it supposed to but the lids break really easy and they’re really expensive to re-purchase and if your coffee is hot in the morning which most people like it hot in the morning the lid quickly gets stuck in a little spout will not open you have to force it so that part maybe not really like it after these few months. So I bought this mug at Christmas as a relative got one for a gift I liked the look and it seems really nice well it’s actually a good mag keep your drinks hot and cold just like it supposed to but the lids break really easy and they’re really expensive to re-purchase and if your coffee is hot in the morning which most people like it hot in the morning the lid quickly gets stuck in a little spout will not open you have to force it so that part maybe not really like it after these few months And actually I was rather surprised because of yeti I thought was a very good brand proved me wrong  And they are by no means cheap mags either.', \"So...I am a klutz.  After dropping many glasses and mugs, we decided to get some more robust cups.  We tried acrylic, but those crack too.  We got the Yeti brand simply because after having other brands, these can be totally taken apart to wash!  The lid magnet comes off, the gasket can be removed easily to wash.  Perfect!  We had some cheaper brands where there were a few sliding non-removable parts or air valves in the lid where I could not scrub and after several months, black mold would out come out when I soaked and shook these underwater. Gross, gross, gross & into the garbage!!  Sure these cost a bit more, but I haven't broken them (dropped & dented...yes, but still functional) and they can be completely cleaned.\", 'Update: Day 5, it leaks from the spout. I went to give someone a hug while holding my Yeti. The spout was closed, and it leaked all over both of us! And it doesn’t keep my coffee hot. So that kinda worked out in this situation for both of us...but I’d rather drink hot coffee, than lukewarm. Changing my 4 stars to 3. I think I’m going back to Contigo....Today was the first use. I previously used the Contigo Snap Seal, but the rubber washer ring failed and started to leak.Pros: I liked the vacuum seal lid. I had leak issues with the Contigo lid. There are no rubber washers to deal with.  It did not leak. Some reviewers said theirs leaked. First day, no leak! I liked that there are not a lot of grooves to clean. I’m not worried about mold buildup or coffee stains because the lid is clear and not a lot of grooves to get into. I had that issue with the Contigo.Cons: It did not stay hot. I left the spout hole open and it was cold within 3 hours. That would not happen to the contigo.  I also didn’t like that it didn’t have a handle. As a mom to a toddler, I need a handle. When your kid is demanding you hold all of his belongings, you need a handle. So I shelled out an extra $10 for a handle. Seems a little steep. The width is also an issue for my cup holder in my car. It’s too wide, and with the handle it’s worse.Conclusion: TBD. As long as it doesn’t start to leak, I’m satisfied. I’ll update if anything changes.', \"I don't care what anyone says, Yeti products are of a higher quality than any of their competitors. Are the differences super noticeable, not necessarily, but if it is a difference of $5 between a Yeti product and its cheaper competitor I will take the higher quality product.\", \"The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Product looks good, looks durable and holds the temperature very well. But this is definitely not leak proof at all. See video and obtain your conclusions. I'm returning this item, very disappointed and with coffee stains in my jacket.\", 'Rugged, excellent insulating, a well-designed lid. Pretty much what YETI is known for. The slider on the lid uses what I believe is a pair of magnets arranged in what would be called and \"over-center mechanism\" if it used springs. The magnets are set up to repel one another if the slider is midway between open and closed. So whichever way it is, it stays, until you push it the other way. It has a very smooth, solid feel.The seal on the lid is neoprene or something like it, with a pair of squeegee ribs to seal against the inside of the cup. It\\'s removable for cleaning, but if you\\'re like me (short fingernails), you may have difficulty removing it. Here\\'s a weird trick (sorry, I couldn\\'t resist) I came up with to take it out: lightly moisten a paper towel or napkin, press it lightly against the ribs with your thumb, and drag your thumb sideways. The seal rolls right out.', 'I was in Punta Cana last week at an all-inclusive resort and everyone had their insulated cups except for me! I had my Yeti colster with me because I usually drink beer out of a can, but the only cans they had were nip size, so my colster didn’t work, plus I wasn’t a fan of their canned beer, so I was left with drinking mixed drinks and frozen drinks out of plastic cups all week while everyone else was drinking theirs out of their insulated cups. When I purchased my colster a few years ago, I also purchased a top with a straw, thinking that the top fit on the colster but it didn’t. The top with the colster was for the 20 Oz rambler, so that’s what I ordered. Everyone knows the quality of Yeti products so the stars don’t matter. The only reason I’m giving this 4 stars is because the colors don’t match. My colster is Tahoe Blue and my rambler is Reef Blue. Amazon didn’t have any 20 Oz Tahoe Blue ramblers, so I’m stuck with 2 different colored blue Yeti’s when I wanted them to be the same color', 'This is my second Yeti I’ve purchased and another one I’ve been disappointed with. I guess I bought into this Yeti hype and thought they must be really good since they are so popular. I couldn’t have been more wrong. The other one I purchased for water, never kept ice for more than a few hours. Replaced it by Amazon and new one exactly the same. Purchased this one now for taking coffee to work. Doesn’t even stay hot which is what is meant to do. I’ve just come to the conclusion Yeti has somehow fooled everyone into thinking their brand is great or it’s just a status symbol to show you own a Yeti because they are overpriced pieces of trash. The bottles and stuff my wife has bought and Walmart and Target have done better than Yeti and less than half the price. Go for a Zak! Or Tal before purchasing this ripoff that doesn’t even work.', \"I usually NEVER leave reviews for anything I buy on Amazon.  But this one, I want to.  I just want to express how disappointed I am in this product.  I've always, always, ALWAYS wanted a Yeti.  I've heard SO much good and positive reviews/feedback on all of their products.  I finally decided to purchase one for myself.  What a disappointment for me!  I'm speaking for myself, not anyone else.I read that the Yeti will keep your beverage hot/cold for X amount of hours.  I have to say that my coffee was only lukewarm after 90 minutes.  This Yeti is a 20 oz but it was kind of cumbersome to handle and it did actually slip out of my hand.  The biggest irk I have with this product, is that it is NOT leak proof!!  Mine leaked out through the magslider even though the magslider was slid to the close position!  Needless to say, rather than return the item, I did just add it to my collection of tumblers in the cabinet and switched back to my Costco bought brand.  I'm disappointed, especially the leak.  IMO, this item is not worth it.\", 'I had been searching for a while for the perfect mug. It fits perfectly in the cup holder of my car and keeps my tea warm for hours after putting it in there. I do see some reviews complaining about the mug leaking, but I advise you to not fill it to the brim. My drink did not leak since I did not fill it to the top. Highly recommend!', 'The lid leaks bad. Just driving to work and hitting a few bumps in the road yields leakage out of the mouth peace and the vent holes under the magnetic slider leading to puddling of my drink on top of the lid. Walking from my vehicle to my desk at work yields even more leakage, not to mention how uncomfortable this tumbler is to carry. Cleaning the tumbler is a pain for me as I cannot get my hand all the way to the bottom to clean the tumbler. I expected this product to be so much better as it carries the YETI name, however, if I knew then what I know now I never would have purchased this item. I am extremely disappointed.', \"I love this tumbler! I filled it with cold water from the  fridge around 10PM, and when I woke up at 7AM, the water was still cold. I've been using Kleen Kanteen bottles (with cozies) for years, but by morning my water was always room temperature, so I decided to upgrade to insulated stainless steel. The Rambler  seems very well made with a perfect powder coat. It's got a nice heft to it, and the MagSlider lid opens and closes with a firm snap. The problem is, Amazon has started shipping almost everything in padded mailers. The Yeti tumbler is wrapped in plastic so a padded mailer doesn't provide sufficient protection during shipping. Guess what? This morning I noticed a small dent in the side of the tumbler. I've already registered it on the Yeti site, so I guess I'll have to contact them. I've been a Prime member for many years, and I buy LOTS of stuff from Amazon. But it's getting old having to return items that were damaged in shipping due to Amazon's inadequate packaging. 5 stars on this fantastic Yeti tumbler, 0 starts for Amazon.\", 'Sure, the coffee mug looks good and I really wanted it to work but its a no go for me. This thing leaks from 2 points of the mag slider. My coffee stayed warm for about 2 hours and I think thats being generous. Maybe if you are staying home and drinking your coffee under 2 hours this mug is perfect for you. I tried bringing it to work this morning and I usually carry my portable coffee mugs in the side pocket of my back pack. I set it down in my car and it spilled all over my seat. At work I refilled it and was driving around in my work truck watching this thing leak through the lid. Two hours had gone by and my coffee was almost room temp. Weak! I just printed up a return slip to send back', \"I only purchased Yeti because I was under the impression that the quality is 2nd to none. I couldn't have been more wrong. My first time using this , I put my hot coffee into my bag as I go to work. I closed it i sealed it etc. Next thing I know my bag is leaking coffee. My computer and my work document are soaked. My suit is soaked. All because I thought this cup wouldn't leak everywhere. I'm extremely disappointed and frustrated. I try to get a refund and they want me to ship it back and deal with that hassle. Looks like its back to hydroflask for me.\", 'I love this cup but it works too well. I pour coffee or tea in it on my way out of the house in the mornings and it stays boiling hot for hours!I poured myself some coffee before leaving my house around 8:15am and I get home from running errands at about noon and my coffee is still super hot! Like burn your mouth hot! I pour my drinks from my yeti cup into a coffee mug so it cools down enough to drink it. It’s too efficient! It’s literally such a well made cup that I’m annoyed with how well it works! Lol.I would recommend it but maybe put some ice cubes in with your hot drinks!', 'It seems very little expanse was spared in making this cup. The vacuum chamber works great for insulating cup contents. Almost too good! Morning coffee is still extremely hot at lunch time, and burns can occur if you forget how well this cup works. Note on common criticism; This cup is not supposed to be leak proof. It is only splash proof. This is by design. Watch the company engineers on YouTube talk about it. Basically, you give up leak-proof for something that is the easiest to clean in the industry. The magnetic top on this cup is so hygienic it is well worth not being able to carry the cup upside down.', 'I didn’t want to spend the extra $ for a Yeti when other insulated cups did the same thing, but I finally caved because friends kept telling me how hot their coffee was. BAD move! My coffee is a step above lukewarm after an hour and barely warm after 4. I will stick with my generic mugs and mark this up as a lesson learned. Did I mention I am bummed because I really like everything else about the mug', 'Eh. I always thought Yeti better be some good crap for how much they charge. But, I lost my fav thermos and thought I’d give this a go.The most disappointing part is the lid leaks! The mag slider works smoothly but the coffee comes out of it. Not fast.  But if you tilt it, it’ll drip. Was really hoping for a tight seal, but you’d need rubber gaskets on the mag slider to make that happen.Didn’t keep my coffee hot for as long as I thought it should either.Ah well. Will not buy their coolers.', \"Received the Yeti Rambler 20 oz tumbler. I loved the color sea foam green. It is a graduation gift which I'm giving today, 5-7-21. I was placing the cup in the gift bag & noticed the leakproof lid looked odd, there was no magnet on the lid to close over the opening. I bought the cup & handle, pd over $40.00 total & now I have to pay $10.00 for the replacement magnet. I just now got it out of the box it was shipped in & the magnet is not in the box. VERY DISAPPOINTED.\", 'Strong like. However, I am not crazy about how you can clean the top. I wish it came apart so you could really get the nooks and crannies. Honestly, I wouldn’t buy another one. Wal-Mart sells a brand by the name of “Built” and they’re a fraction of the cost, for a cup just as good, if not better. You’re basically paying for the Yeti name with this one. There’s definitely other, cheaper brands that do the same job and look just as nice.', \"I purchased this Yeti after trying out one just like this given to my husband by a vendor at work. I was so amazed by the fact that his keeps water so cold even a day later. Thinking this would encourage me to drink more water, I purchased one like his.Though it seems like I received the correct product, this certainly doesn't keep my water cold. It's just like any old cup. Of course I threw away the packaging immediately, so I'm stuck with an overpriced cup. I haven't tried coffee in it because if it doesn't keep cold drinks cold, I can't imagine it would keep hot drinks hot.If I try Yeti again, I certainly will not purchase through Amazon, and I will definitely test out the cup before discarding the packaging.\", 'First off I love that this rambler fits in my car cup holder. My other yeti rambler did not and it was a bit annoying. I will say this is not leak proof if you have hot coffee in the cup and it falls over you can count on the coffee leaking out. Has more to do with heat and steam pressuring the cup and forcing it through the mag slide. On a positive note it will not be the same with a cold drink inside. Possibly if I turned it upside down and shook it maybe. I have tilted it upside down with a cold drink and no problem again do not try this with coffee. All in all I’m happy', \"It works great, keeps hot stuff hot and cold stuff cold for a couple hours at least (that's as long as I've tested it anyway). I generally use mine for lattes, and I've actually started steaming the milk to only a lukewarm level since it doesn't cool off at all in there and it was sort of uncomfortable to drink something that hot from start to finish. If you're like me at all, you'll be used to drinking stone cold coffee at the end because you tend to forget about it for an hour or two, but the Yeti rambler doesn't let that happen!. The lid on mine is leak proof, no problems, unlike several people in these reviews who may or may not know how to put a lid on correctly, just saying. I'm very pleased with it, anyway, and it works just as well as the ancient Yeti my friend left in my car which I used for months before returning to her.\", \"I have purchased Yeti mugs from Dick's Sporting Goods in the past and they work great so I am familiar with Yeti's product. I ordered one of these cups and liked the color so ordered another one for a family member. We only use these cups for cold beverages. The cups worked fine for few weeks but then the outside of the cup began to feel cold after filling it with ice and beverage and it stopped keeping ice for more than 3-4 hours. I don't believe these are brand Yeti. I wish I had trialed the first one before buying the second one.\", \"I've tried to a ridiculous degree to find a thermal cup for travel that is rugged, fits the console, and has an easy-to-clean sup lid. My journey ended with this product from Yeti. While the size may be too big for some, it's an easy grip for me and textured external finish guarantees it won't slip or sweat. I use it for iced drinks more than cold and really provides terrific insulation. This was a win/win for me.\", 'We’re all supposed to drink more water, right?  For me, I only like water that’s very cold, so I tend to not finish it when it gets room temp. Because it stays cold in this bottle; I’m drinking it all day! Also, my fingers can’t touch very hot or cold things; so this is perfect as the outside doesn’t feel cold.I don’t worry about spilling because of the lid, which easily slides open and closed with one finger. It’s dishwasher safe, but I don’t even use it, because Its super easy to clean being so wide and I never want to be without it!', \"I have a YETI 30oz rambler and I love it. I bought this one for my wife because it's smaller and will be easier for her to hold. She's pretty weak and the 30oz is really heavy. When she takes a sip of mine, she has a hard time lifting it to her mouth.  The 20oz I bought her is a bit lighter so it seems it will work out a bit better for her. She loves the color and it keeps cold drinks cold for long periods of time and hot drinks hot for long times. You can put ice cubes and water in the cup at 7am, and as long as you vacuum seal it, if you come back at 5pm, there will still be ice in it. Absolutely amazing tech and YETI ramblers/cups are of the highest quality. Worth every penny in my book. 5 stars!\", \"Yes! I've had more than my share of crappy coffee mugs. I got to the point where I was wondering why such a seemingly simple thing could be so difficult. This one hits all the marks. It's easy to clean. It's keeps liquid cold or hot. The top removes and reapplies easily. It's easy and comfortable to hold. And, you can drink out of it easily without worry of spillage. This one wins. Perfection. Finally!\", \"I gave it 2 stars because of all the hype they give this product. the biggest and only upsets I had and the reason for my return was that the 20oz cup only hold about 14 1/2oz of liquid. the other upset thing is that my coffee was pipping hot like I prefer for about 1 hour Max. I'm sure there are better tumblers on Amazon for a 3rd of the price in comparison to this one. Sorry Yeti wanted to be a fan but you failed. also Sorry that Yeti CS did not want to send me an RA to investigate the cup and see if they accidentally stamped this cup 20oz instead of 16oz. all YETI cs told me was sorry there is nothing we can do.\", 'I did just get this, so maybe there will be an update, but I honestly have no idea what the bad reviews are speaking of. They make it sound like a knock-off. It is not! It is a Yeti. The lid is a mag and is high quality. I tried to mimic the spillage complaints on the “no spill lid”, perhaps if you hold it upside down it may leak. Bumps and quick tips do not spill out. I could not be happier with this product. Again, it’s a day in. If I have a change in my review, I will update ;-)', \"I bought a YETI Rambler 20 oz stainless steel tumbler to replace one lost in our house.  My sister-in-law, a runner, gifted one to my husband several years ago, and he fell in love with it.  This cup keeps ice overnight with very little sweating.  We have no idea where the original is hiding, and he missed it so much I had to get another just like it.  Glad I found it here, and even though it cost $20, it's more than worth the price in his estimation. If and when we find the original, maybe I'll get hooked on it too.\", 'This item does keep things either cold or hot, however is not a leak proof design, which I did not know at time of purchase.

I purchased two, 2, tumblers to use as a cold beverage tumbler while vacationing in 95 plus degree weather, expecting it to perform like the hype of YETI, and that all their products are supposed to be outstanding.  This product is extremely disappointing.  The ice in the beverage did not even last 30 minutes.  All products put into the tumbler were straight out of the freezer or refrigerator and the ice was melted within 30 to 45 minutes and the beverage was warm within one hour, which made it undrinkable.  The lid it comes with is a clear plastic that offers very little in the form of insulation.  Were the tumbler to have an insulated non-clear lid, like I have with my thermos tumbler, it would have potential to be a much better insulated tumbler and perhaps a good product.  The clear plastic lid is what makes it a very disappointing YETI product.', 'So very happy I purchased this yeti from Amazon. I bought this to have for my sons soccer tournament weekend. (lost my other yeti a few weeks before this purchase). Came right on time and right away checked for leaks (as mentioned in other reviews). No leaks at all. The morning we we got to the field I tossed it in our wagon and no leaks or spills. Perfect size for our cup holder and my hand.', 'I might be the last person on earth to own anything made by Yeti.  There are relentless advertising and ridiculous pricing has made me turn away from the ground every opportunity I get. I mean, seriously???  People are wearing hats and sweatshirts for a company that keeps things cold?! Ok, to each their own But now let’s talk about how this thing works. Holy moly it’s incredible! I have left cold drinks with ice in a black car smack in the middle of July in New England. It was hot!!  When I got back to the car later that night I was shocked to find that almost all the ice was still inside the tumbler and the drink was as cold as it was when I left it earlier that morning. Wow!  I also have to admit that the magnetic lid drink whole cover is very pleasing to open and close. I like when the small details are given attention.So, I might not be wearing Yeti hats or sweatshirts anytime soon but for sure I’m a believer that this brand is making exceptional products and I’d buy this tumbler again.', \"I'm a Contigo guy, but I had heard good things about Yeti so I decided to give them a whirl. I have to say, I don't like it, no sir...I just don't like it. To be fair this rambler/tumbler is nice as far as aesthetics go, but simple functionality task is where it fails miserly. By this I mean, it leaks. I know! I know! It states in the description that the MagSlider Lid is not leakproof. But we are talking about leak issues when walking from point A to point B people. I'm not white water rafting with it. I get less of a mess using a standard 15 oz ceramic mug. So it's for this reason, that I will be returning back to my go to...the Conti-GO!\", 'This is the WORST travel mug I\\'ve ever used.  I guess it\\'s ok if you don\\'t actually travel with it.  The lid is the problem.  They don\\'t come out and say in the description that it\\'s \"leak proof\".  You have to go to the manufacturer web site and watch a video to learn that.  It\\'s not even \"splash proof\".  The liquid inside easily comes out just with normal motion of carrying it.Also, when you drink from it, some liquid pools up in front of the hole, so if you snap the closure shut after drink it it can splash up.  I got some on my glasses while driving, which was NOT COOL.Stay away from this mug!!!', \"Firstly yes I do like this a lot and use it as my daily traveler.Pros.Works mostly as marketed.Has a good warrantee.The lid fits tight.The magnetic slider is AWESOME.Cons.Expensive.Is NOT leak proof.Doesn't keep your drink hot for all that long, but still long enough for you to chug your home brew before work.Does NOT fit all car mug holders. I've used it in 5 different cars and only one car had a holder that this fit with ease.\", \"The Yeti Tumbler isn't what you want, unless you want a probable knock-off with a lid that is incapable of closing (the part that closes the lid isn't even included).This product fell victim to the all-too-common pattern:1. Product sells well and receives tons of 5-star ratings2. Product becomes popular on Amazon3. Customers begin receiving shady, probable knock-off products instead of the ones that prompted the numerous high ratings4. Nothing is done about it\", 'All pros and no cons. I had received the exact same tumbler from a company as a gift for my purchase and I was so impressed with it that I ordered one from Amazon. It’s the only tumbler that keeps my coffee hot, that’s right hot not warm through your the day.  Are they pricey yes but they are well worth it. I also want to add that I had my new tumbler with me and I was getting my things out of my truck when my tumbler fell and hit the ground. No visual scratches or dings that I could tell of. Overall I’m just super happy and very satisfied with this product.', \"Had a hard time replacing my worn out Starbucks coffee travel mug; went through a couple of replacements until I found this. Excellent design and workmanship. I love the magnetic slider lid. The combination of a good o-ring seal and the slider mechanism worked great. keeps my coffee nice and hot, and doesn't interfer with my nose as I drink it! Only thing I would have done different is decreasing the OD a little for small hands and moving that into the overall length. Overall the best travel mug on the market, in my humble opinion.\", 'This is One of the best insulated tumbler ever used. Super cool design with super cool technology inside.I use it for my coffee, didn’t try the cold drinks yet.With my use and testing, I noticed, it keeps the hotness for atleast 6-8 Hrs min.Very easy to clean and use.Overall I am satisfied with the product.', \"These are the best travel mugs. They keep drinks hot or cold for a very long time. You can purchase additional lids with the large reusable straws for cold drinks or water. They wash very well in the dishwasher. We love the colors. We love how they feel when you hold them in your hand and how they don't leak in our bags. At first the lids are super tight and a bit hard to remove and put back on, but over time that goes away. I have had one for a long time now and washed it in the dishwasher I don't know how many times and it is still good as new. I love buying these to give as gifts, they are great gifts! We will be buying more for sure.\", \"We own three (black, white, and blue).  I like that the cups are dishwasher safe; most competitors' cups are not.  The magnetic lid closure is brilliant.  It makes cleaning the lid a breeze.  Everything else is pretty much like other, lesser priced cups.  The lid does NOT seal, by the way, so if that's important to you, this isn't the cup for you.  We're plenty happy with ours.\", \"Yeti has made a name for itself with its excellent and innovative coolers.  This is another excellent product from the company.  The insulation in the mug is outstanding without affecting the sleek design.  I've had ice cubes remain frozen overnight and coffee will stay warm for hours.  The magnetic sliding closure is an excellent innovation and makes the top of the mug easy to clean.  Other mugs I have owned tend to drip when brought up for a sip.  Not this one!  However, you should be aware that well well sealed with a rubber O-ring, this mug will leak if turned on its side.  Otherwise fantastic.  I bought two.\", \"Got this for my husband for Christmas, since he already has one that he loves in the color blue. However, after we put it in the dishwasher(top rack) the water stains remained on the outsid, hoped after more washes it would go away, but no such luck. This never happened to our blue one, which we bought in a store, which was more expensive and we had it for a year. Makes me believe that buying here may be the cheaper version or the original, unfortunately. For that reason I'm giving it a 3 star rating.I feel that I should get my refund without having to send this back for this reason but I am not given that option with Amazon. I am returning this.\", 'I didn\\'t believe they hype about Yeti tumblers until my wife, who doesn\\'t drink coffee or tea, received one from her work.  I used it and was immediately convinced of its ability to keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold.  I bought this one to replace my wife\\'s Yeti, that I stupidly left at a hotel during our travels.  BE AWARE THAT THE MAGSLIDER LID DOES NOT MAKE THE MUG LEAK-PROOF.  Even with the MagSlider lid closed, your drink will leak if you tip the mug onto its side.  It\\'s kinda like thinking the \"sippy lid\" will ABSOLUTELY PREVENT any liquid from making it to your shirt.  It won\\'t.', '2.5 Stars. I\\'m  really disappointed. I heard all the great things about the Yeti.  How it hold ice forever, how you could sit it in a hot car for hours without melting the ice, blah blah blah blah. Not true. At least not with the one I got. Maybe it\\'s a dudd. I don\\'t bother with returns, but I am seriously tempted to return this. I just spent $29 on 20 oz container that won\\'t hold ice for 5 hours, and it melts consistently during that entire time.  By the way I notice that one of the items it doesn\\'t ask to the customer to rate is \"Does it keep it cold very long?\".', 'I was really expecting more from the Yeti brand. This is the first time I’ve ordered their product. This thing only keeps coffee hot for about 2 hours. And it’s pretty huge so hard to bring along in the car and drink with one hand. Other brand that I’ve used for years and sadly didn’t order because I ordered this keeps it hot at least 6 hours AND in a frozen Wisconsin car! I’ll probably never order Yeti again, will stick with my Thermos!!', 'I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it - we both love the magnetic closure which is so easy to clean but keeps the liquid contained - I am contemplating ordering another one for myself', \"I love Yetis and have many of them, far too many if you ask my husband. My husband ordered this one from Amazon for Mother's day. I always order from the company's site myself. I've never had to inspect any of my prior Yeti purchases, as they were flawless. I did what I always do: opened it, washed it, used it, washed it again. It was upon putting it away that I noticed the rusty ding in the bottom of the cup.I know that all of my other Yetis are still in pristine condition after nearly 2 years. I'm very careful and protective of them because they cost a fortune. Not sure if I try for a replacement from Yeti or Amazon, as I'm not sure where the damage originated.\", \"I knew it was over-priced, but I bought into the hype. It is too heavy, and the shape is difficult to hold comfortably in a smaller hand. It does keep coffee warm for a couple of hours, haven't tried it with cold drinks. The magnetic slider on the lid is neat. It does leak a little if the cup is turned over - but nowhere in the product description does it say it doesn't leak. I can't imagine paying a higher price for colored cups. My advice, save your money and buy a cheaper cup.\", 'Bought this thing after avoiding this brand for so long. Just always felt it was overpriced. Welp I gave in because I was tired of my $10-15 Walmart cups that fall apart, but they don’t leak….. This thing I was pumped because I figured this would be “you get what you pay for” nope, this thing leaks any chance it get gets a lil tip…', 'I wanted a convenient-sized double-walled stainless steel tumbler that would be perfect for my morning coffee during my work commute. I also wanted one that would be able to come with a convenient lid/straw combination (separately purchased the Yeti brand lid/straw) for my cold drinks. I have two Hydroflask water bottles, but I didn’t like the design of their tumblers (or how big their logo placement was on the cups). So I wanted to find a tumbler that had an overall good design that I knew could work well.This has been such a great tumbler and a convenient size! It’s small enough where I won’t need to drink too much coffee, but it’s big enough to get me through the day. Even iced coffee that I put in the cup around 8am, the ice was still in the cup until 3-4pm (which was pretty impressive to me). My bf has a Yeti cooler that works amazingly well, so I’m glad I could find that same quality in the cup!I haven’t used the original lid it came with so I can’t comment on how well it works or not... but I high recommend getting the Yeti lid/straw with it to enjoy cool drinks.', 'I carefully reviewed all competing products available and noted that most reviews were critical of the ability to hold temperature. Importantly and surprisingly, this criticism extended to this Yeti product so I was reluctant especially considering the relatively high cost. I\\'ve now owned this cup for two months. I\\'ve used it daily for both hot and cold drinks, lately mostly cold since temperatures here in the desert have been over 100° nearly every day for the past two weeks. I\\'m not sure what kind of use others are giving this cup but I can assure you, this is by far the best thermal cup I\\'ve ever encountered.Yesterday, after starting out at 8am with \"light ice\" coffee (Starbucks, possibly a half dozen small ice cubes), the cup sat all day in a closed vehicle. We drove 3-1/2 hours each way from Moab, UT to Salt Lake City and back. The cup, now less than 1/4 full spent nearly 2 hours parked in the desert sun with the lid on. Upon arriving back home, I realized I had forgotten to finish my iced coffee and was amazed to find the cup still contained 3 small ice cubes rattling around!Bottom line: Assuming you buy an actual Yeti cup, it will work better than anything else - and although I can\\'t commend Yeti for the lid\\'s drinkability, the new magnetic closure nearly eliminates spillage whenever the cup is knocked over.', 'I never could bring myself to buy a $30 travel mug but I have to say im now a believer ! I was tired of buying mugs that would sweat on hot days or be too cold to hold but this mug is amazing !! First time I used it I filled it w ice cubes and made an iced coffee to go at 8am ... I work in a shop where there is NO AC ! Not only did my coffee stay cold all day but the ice NEVER melted and I left work at 5:30pm !! Not to mention NO sweating and not a touch of cold on the outside of the tumbler . Just worth EVERY penny ... Bravo Yeti !', \"I ordered this YETI Rambler based on a friend's recommendation and am not at all disappointed thus far. I tried it out with a cold drink in 90 degree weather and my beverage was evenly chilled until the very end! I especially like how easy the lid is to clean!\", 'We have nearly a dozen of these that my wife uses for water, for soda and for Atkins shakes.You really do need to purchase the handles for them, but they are a superior, if pricey, product.They do clean up well, but you really should get a sponge with a handle to do the best job.  We\\'ve had reasonably good luck with the \"Power Puff,\" but you definitely do want a device that doesn\\'t taper down at the bottom because the mug\\'s bottom is a bit raised from its sides.', \"If you've had any Yeti products, they're almost all great. They are a bit pricey but they do seem to higher quality as well. I used to have an RTIC tumbler but splurged for one of these and I much prefer this one, if not only for the texture and feel of the outside. I've since purchased two of these bad boys and constantly use them to take coffee to-go. I have a couple of other travel coffee mugs but much prefer these to the Alladin ones that I also have.Also, if you've never used the Mag Slide lid, I now use nothing else on tumblers. The sliding of the lid is pretty satisfying and has a great click and it's also super easy to clean. I've even bought one of those lids to put on a Yeti knock-off cup that my work gave me.The lids are by no means leak proof, and if you shake it much liquid does come out. I knew this going in, but it's good to note in case you are expecting that. Also, since you can wash these in the dish washer, cleaning is super easy and convenient.\", \"So we have magnets for added nerd tech feature.  Cool.  Unfortunately we forgot to check the fact that IT LEAKS!  It's not a little leak either.  It leaks a LOT.  Go look at the videos other reviewers were nice enough to put up.  If you need a cup that won't leak profusely, find a different cup.  I'm trying out Jura's.  It comes with two lids just so you can have a travel lid that DOESN'T leak if you're so inclined.Another bad part of the design is that the lid which leaks isn't that easy to clean under the sliding mechanism.  If you don't immediately rinse the lid after use (because the thing leaks so much) you'll find it won't slide because whatever you were drinking dried underneath it.So now for the good part.  Does the cup appear to insulate decently?  Yes.  Does that really matter when the lid sucks?  Not so much unless you have another lid to use since the Yeti one's garbage.\", \"In a clear attempts to capitalizing on the performance of the coolers (which I love), these are a big fail and reflect poorly on the name. Bottom line: They don't keep coffee.  They spill easily and the tops are hard to clean. I have two different travel mugs from Dunkin Donuts that keep my coffee much hotter, don't leak, and the tops clean easily an completely.  Yeti, stick to the cooler business.\", 'I was always skeptical of the claims that Yeti is \"the best.\" $30 for a travel mug? Not likely... but after several others broke I decided to suck it up. My husband recently received a similar model Yeti tumbler that I was using constantly, so I bought another one. $30 for the black 20 oz tumbler, and now I need even more! I use it constantly for hot drinks, and sometimes for cold when I travel. It is amazing at keeping the temperature, and the quality- it\\'s so, so sturdy! Plus it\\'s dishwasher safe! What more could you ask for? I expect this thing to outlive me, and I can\\'t wait to order more in other, prettier colors. BUY THIS.', 'I purchased this cup to replace a Starbucks 20 oz double walled cup that I use to drink water out of.  I like my water cold so I add ice to the cup to chill it.  When I got the Yeti cup, I was surprised because it was so much smaller than my Starbucks 20 oz cup (see photo).  I used a measuring cup to pour 20 ounces of water in it and was disappointed that it filled the cup to the brim.  Not what I expected.  The cup does keep my water cold but the ice melts faster than the Starbucks cup.  The Yeti cup is wider than I prefer but that is my fault, I misread the dimensions before ordering the cup.  The material is pretty good quality but I wished the cup was a little taller to accommodate more liquid.', \"I can't remember what problem I was trying to solve when I bought a YETI coffee tumbler, but it does a great job of keeping coffee hot (and ice water cold).  I don't find the MagSlider lid difficult to use without coffee dribbling down my lip.  I'll use it at home and will never travel with it, so I can't rate whether or not it's leak proof, but why would I expect any item without a solid cap to not leak?I like the shape.  I don't know why folks who make these grossly over-sized coffee things think they have to fit vehicle cup-holders, but the YETI has a pleasant shape the makes it easier to get a secure grip on it.THEY'RE TOO EXPENSIVE.  Like every YETI product , there's a steep upcharge for the name.  It almost convinced me to NOT buy it, but I'm happy with how it performs, and I recommend it.\", \"I had used a Bubba Cup for years.  Love them, kept everything so hot but I could no longer get them clean (coffee stains). So I caved in and bought a Yeti.  I finally found one that was a reasonable price.  It is nice looking.  I had to buy a handle because my grip isn't what it used to be.  Cover is easy to get off and on, and therein lies the issue I think.  My Bubba Cup cover screwed on and the tab to close it was tight.  The Yeti is not as tight and so it doesn't keep the coffee hot as long.  But I do like the way it looks, I wanted the lime green one but that was like $55 everyplace I could find it and I couldn't justify that much money for a coffee cup.\", \"I was so excited to get my cup because I already  have the larger Yeti and I love it.  I got this version for my coffee.  I used a Contigo for 5 years and it never leaked and kept my coffee warm for hours.The first morning I used my new cup it spilled ALL over my work back and the contents in it (including electronics).  So I figured that I just can't put it in my bag.  I used it again, and I carried it this time.  Any tipping of the cup spills liquid, so I ended up with coffee all over my gloves, jacket, and work clothes.  Then when I got to work, in about 20 minutes, my coffee is barely luke-warm.  The first time I figured it was because so much spilled.This cup is NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  I was better off with my $8 Contigo, which I am going to purchase again!\", \"People always rate travel mugs by how long the drink stays warm. Yes, that is important; and Yeti does a good job as long as the lid is closed.The thing that always was a deal breaker for me with every other travel mug was cleaning it out. Unless you were completely disassembling it and steam cleaning it every night, at some point you would probably notice some black gunk in the gasket or in the spout somewhere. Gaskets are no problem to clean but some mugs have impossible places to clean.The magnet lock lid is the best thing I've ever seen.  It never gets dirty! I clean all around it just in case. Clean the gasket and after months of use, I have yet to see any gunk.Great product!\", 'I wish it was designed with a screw on lid. Luckily, only once (so far) has my cup been knocked over, but the lid opened and spilled my delicious & hot coffee all over the place. A screw top could have prevented that. Other than that it’s great and has an innovative magnetic sliding hole cover that helps to makes it a snap to clean and is roughly unbreakable. I’ve replaced too many coffee cups due to broken hinges and clips and other lid-cap-closing-things.', 'I did not think ahead. I reheat my coffee in the microwave. This item cannot be put into a microwave.  My mistake so overall lower 3 star rank is based on that.Cleaning is a small problem.  Should the \"magnetized\" slider stay attached to the lid at all times or does it need to be removed and cleaned separately?  I can do either but removing this fairly small piece could result in it\\'s being misplaced or lost.  I would have bought something different just for that fact alone.  The mug does keep liquids hotter much longer so if that is what you are looking for, this may be what you need!', 'It is a yeti. It does have the mag slide . Was no damage to it. It will leak if you tip over, can’t imagine it spilling in your cup holder in the car unless your off-roading.But.... it doesn’t keep it hot as I would imagine. Part of this reason is maybe I’m not closing the mag slide after I sip on it.My contigo does a better job at keeping it hot since it closes the lid as soon as your finger comes off the button.  Verdict... nice but for the price I expect better temperature results, even if the mag slide is open.Update, it is dishwasher safe but there are watermarks on it now that don’t come off.', \"This tumbler means BUSINESS!! For a while I avoided buying a YETI brand travel mug because I had heard there were a lot of counterfeits so I took a long while and tried a lot of other brands before I finally buckled up and got this. It is easily the best one I've owned! It keeps things COLD cold for hours -- it doesn't keep things hot for quite as long, but you can easily get several hours of nice hot coffee with it. Just to test it out I put some ice water in it yesterday and the ice didn't melt for over eight hours! It's also just about perfectly sized for a cupholder.My only qualm is that it's a little bit hard to hold; I have very small hands and I can't quite get a good grip on it. That said, that's a pretty minor gripe, and most people with larger hands than mine won't have that issue. If you've been holding out on buying a YETI tumbler, just take the plunge!\", 'Arrived damaged but knowing I was only going to kick it around daily, why bother. It’s 100% not leak proof / resistant, it spills. It keeps liquids hot / cold just the same as generic Walmart brands do, so with that said it’s overpriced.

We opened the box and thought a mistake had been made, because these are more like dark bronze, much darker than what the photo shows.  We are returning them, since they were for a \"copper\" anniversary gift.  These definitely are not copper!  However, they are heavy and look like they\\'d be substantial.  The magnetic lid piece to one was in the box - it had come off the lid due to the sparse packing material included (the containers were rolling around in the box only protected but by a thin plastic sleeve).  Overall, we\\'re disappointed and not impressed.', \"Love this Yeti rambler, works as advertised, and so far I have only used it for coffee, and holds it pretty hot for a long time.

Cup has a nice finish.  It feels sturdy and well built.  But a little big which makes it a little tiring to hold for a long time.  Keeps coffee hot for a good 4 hours.The big disappointment is in the lid.  It is not splash-proof!!!  If it tips the slightest bit, or if the coffee comes in contact with the lid, it leaks through the sliding lid.  Coffee bubbles and spurts through gaps in the lid and fills up on top the clear lid.  If the cup is sitting perfectly flat, it drains back into the mouth opening.  But if it's tipped the slightest bit, coffee leaks off the lid and all over.  I've tried carrying in an outside cup holder on my messenger bag twice.  Both times coffee spilled while carrying in the holder, just from slight bounces of my bag.  Once, coffee got all over my coat and bag.  The other time, coffee spilled all over a chair that I set the bag on, even though it was upright.This is a horrible design for such a high price.  I want something that I can carry in the cup holder of my bag.  But I can not do that with the Rambler because it leaks badly out the top.  This cup is only good if you are sitting at a flat table or desk, or if you plan on traveling with the cup in your hand.  And even when I was walking with the cup in my hand, I managed to spill a little coffee when I was not paying attention and slightly tipped a full cup.  Ridiculous!!!\", 'So many bogus and fake reviews on here for YETI Tumblers whose colors do not even exist on the official YETI website. That really should be your first clue.

She wanted a tumbler that was small enough to hold and kept her coffee hot. Let me tell you, this woman likes her coffee 1 degree below the boiling point!😂 Road trips were crazy, stopping every 30 mins, literally, for hot coffee because her insulated tumbler didn't keep it warm. She loves her new Yeti! She says that it keeps her coffee as hot as she likes it until she finishes it. We can take further road trips in shorter amount of time!\", \"I learned what a Yeti was from my oldest son.  He was telling me how great it was at keeping things cold and hot.  They are pricy so I just put off getting one.  I like to enjoy my morning coffee but in a regular cup it cools down pretty quick.  So I decided to bite the bullet and order one.  I LOVE this tumbler and it works as promised.  I enjoy my coffee in the morning (several hours) and I rinse it out and put ice water it around lunch time.  When I go to bed at night I have to dump the ice out that's still in the cup.  It's amazing.  I also love the magslid lid.  It's so easy to work and clean.  The Navy blue color is awesome looking.

I ordered four and when I opened the package I took one out and started to use it right away. I tried to figure out why I did not have a way to close the opening you drink from. I assumed this was just the way they were made. I did not care for that feature. I recently unpack the other three and I found two slide tops that are magnetic that fit onto the top of the Tumbler. I ordered four Tumblers and  I only received two of the removable pieces and they were loose down in the box and I’m surprised I even found them.

Highly recommend, and no issues or concerns here regarding authenticity, this is very clearly genuine Yeti brand.', \"I do very much like the Yeti mug. It keeps my coffee very hot for a very long time.  If you're planning on drinking your hot drink anytime in the near future, you honestly won't need to a mug that can keep it hotter for longer than this one. I've seen reviews claiming that it will keep drinks hot for 8 hours or more, which doesn't seem possible. But for your average person, this mug keeps it way hotter for longer than you'll need. So if keeping your drink hot is  your objective, your mug search ends here.My only probem is that it is not completely leakproof. Every morning, I drop the mug into my laptop bag and unless I keep it completely upright at all times, a little bit of coffee will leak out under the magnet slider. So far, I've never had any coffee spill over the side on to any of my gear. But I do kinda miss my Starbucks mug because it was completely leakproof.But the bottom line is, this is a great mug. I recommend it and would buy another one in a heartbeat.\", \"This is so efficient it keeps coffee so hot that I've gone from drinking 4 cups a day, each of which is an event, to sipping coffee from morning until afternoon - and only getting through 3 max.  Bonus.. now that my wife and I both have one our dishwasher life has changed.  Our top rack is practically empty from the lack of coffee mugs, so we get to throw all the stuff in a load that we would previously hand wash because there's no room.\", \"I own several YETI tumblers and I just love them. They are stylish in their colors and are of high quality. My drinks are always icy cold even if I leave my cup in the car. I have done other cups in the past, but I strictly only by YETI's from now on. The tumbler arrived earlier than expected, nice. If there is a problem with the order, they fix it immediately, I like that. I have sent my daughter one in her favorite color and given them as gifts to friends.\", \"This is my fourth purchase in my quest to find an insulated travel cup that actually works as advertised. This Yeti cup keeps my coffee hot for hours and hours. It's just a bit big and a bit heavy for me, but I have small, arthritic hands. I can put those minor complaints aside because it does its job and does it well. I do like the magnetic open/close slide, but no, it is not leakproof if it tips over. As long as you're aware of that when you buy the cup, you're going to be very pleased with your purchase. It's definitely worth the extra money it costs.\", 'Extremely disappointed.  I have a number of Yeti products and although its been 3 years since I bought one, I expected the Rambler to be of the same quality.  The first thing I noticed was the Magslider lid  is very different from my other Yeti\\'s.  Although the slide is closed all the way, I can drink coffee without opening it.  (I actually went back to check the description to make sure that it was not one of those \"drink lids\").  When I first put the coffee in, the steam \"bubbled\" it up and out around the slide.  When I was carrying the tumbler up the stairs to my office, hot coffee leaked out in appreciable quantities all over my hands with the slightest movement .  To add insult to injury, after an hour the coffee was absolutely cold.  My older Yeti\\'s without the Magslider lid stay hot for 6 or more hours. There is no vacuum insulation on this model.  If you have older Yeti products and are expecting the same performance - you will be disappointed and covered in coffee.', \"Our company bought company branded 20 oz.

I put ice water in it at night, and there is still cold ice water there in the morning. I take it with me everywhere, it fits the cup holder in the car perfectly, and being the ice last forever, I just keep topping it off with my beverage of choice.Haven't tried it with hot liquids, but I would expect good thermal retention. I love mine.\", \"Nice weight to it, it feels tough and durable. I bought it to replace another non-brand name mug that I could no longer buy covers for and decided to get a Yeti because their coolers are great and I can buy replacement covers.The one thing I love/hate about the mug is the Magslider lid... it comes off for cleaning super easy, it slides back and forth nice and is not 100% leak proof.  There is a slight trickle comming out, I suspect it will only get worse as the magnets age.  Is this a deal breaker?  No! The lid leaks less than my last coffee cup and it will keep a vast majority (99%) of the coffee in the cup when it's tipped on it's side.The other thing about the slider is when it's removed, just make sure you hand wash it. I placed the lid and the slider in my dish washer separately and the slider fell through the rack and stuck to the bottom of the bottom dishwasher rack. Little tough to find... so now I keep it in a seperate compartment in the silverware container.As for keeping my coffee hot... honestly I find myself opening the lid to allow it to cool off sometimes 3-4 hours after I made it (depending on external temps).  So far so good!\", 'Mine is definitely an authentic Yeti (I was worried after reading some of the reviews.) I use mine to drink cold drinks, and after several hours, there is still a good amount of ice still in the cup. As many have stated, it is not completely leak-proof, but only if you hold it upside down. If it falls over, nothing escapes the lid or opening. This size is easy to hold with one hand and it cleans very easily (the cup is dishwasher safe).', 'I’ve owned many YETI products and found them to be generally very good-to-excellent. This Rambler 20 oz. Tumbler looks good but disappoints greatly in temperature retention performance. Though COLD liquids remain cold for a decent period of time (50-75 mins. Depending on Outside/Inside  Air Temperatures), HOT liquids are very poorly retained at original temperature. Hot Coffee or Hot Tea at normal consumption temperatures, for instance, become tepid within 15-25 mins at best.  Very poor performance compared to many competitors and very costly for product capability. This appears to be an item with a price point elevated for brand name only.', \"Ok...I love my rambler, but it took me a very angry customer review to Yeti to finally understand the lid is NOT supposed to be leak proof.... Idk why you'd want a non-leak proof lid, but here we are. It does keep ice a long time, and it's become my night stand staple. Every night I fill it with ice water, and the ice is still there in the morning! If I take it to Starbucks it fits the grande drinks great, and keeps them cold all day at work. Love it! I have dropped it several times, and the little magnetic black peice on the lid flew off and was lost. Yeti replaced it tho! Which was great knowing Amazon is a certified seller and allows that! Just registered it when I got it. Also, having that peice be removable makes cleaning a lot easier!\", \"I went 'round and 'round about which thermal coffee cup to get. My friend had the Yeti mug with warmer that kept coffee hot, but the size was too small and I don't like the bitterness that comes with coffee that's been heated for long periods of time.After purchasing this mug, with the plastic ring-handle (sold separately), I have been so pleased. It does a great job of keeping my coffee hot during my morning routine. Yes, it's pricey, but think of the many poor performing ones we try for $15.00 each, and sell at garage sales or donate to Savers.\", \"I have a S'well cup and sure wish I would have purchased that instead.  I bought my son this Yeti cup for Christmas and he isn't having any problems with his.  After drinking from it, the coffee runs down the side of it therefore I constantly have to have it sitting on a paper towel or napkin.  It also does not keep your coffee warm long since I add creamer to mine.  My S'well cup keeps my coffee warm for almost two hours after filling it, this cup lasted about a half hour.  Want to return but can't because its been used.  The box that is came in did not have a Yeti address or label on it, so who knows where this actually came from.\", \"You can't go wrong with a Yeti. I'm not sure why some colors are so much more expensive, but I bought the green color at a reasonable price for my fiancé on his birthday. He had gotten a colorless/stainless steel Yeti from a job and has been using that daily. In contrast, these Yetis with the colored coating offer some type of insulation from coffee so that he can hold it more easily without burning his hand. As with all Yeti products, they hold up well after being washed in the dishwasher, which makes buying a Yeti worth it.\", 'I like this travel mug. I know about all the boasting concerning how long it keeps liquids hot. However it seems to do about the same job as some of my other travel mugs (different brands). Also the tab for sealing and unsealing to drink (FYI) is magnetic and comes off. I did not realize that at first. It pulls off like a magnet would and will reattach easily. When you realize that, it make it easy to clean under the tab. I thought something like that might come off during use. But it does not, I am pretty ruff with mine. The magnet is placed so it is works equally strong in the open or closed position. I thought that the 20 Oz cup may not fit easily into the cup holder in my console; it fits just fine. So overall I like it.', \"This is our 3rd yeti- bought to replace one that didn't stay on the roof of the car all the way home from work, oops (note- this is not a feature available in this style) ;)Keeps drinks incredibly hot, works just as well 2 years later after daily use and going through the dishwasher daily. The new magnetic slider lid is great, but if you need totally spill & leak proof get the “Stop it” lid (available on Amazon) to go with it.All of our other coffee mugs have been retired to the very back of the cabinets.\", \"I got this for my dad.  He has a large Yeti that keeps things cold but he wanted a smaller cup for hot drinks.  I got him the 20 oz. Stainless and splurged on the magnetic lid.  Coffee was luke warm in 30 min.  I called Yeti customer service.  They reviewed the purchase & photos I they asked me to send.  They approved the return and told me the options for getting it back to them. But when I called back to get the return authorization they changed their mind and denied the return until I performed heating/cooling tests before they'd authorize it (even though they had already authorized it).\", \"I bought this for a family member who has been pouring their smoothies to-go into a glass juice bottle with a narrow neck, which is not easy to clean and breakable. I wanted to make their life more manageable, so I ordered this model based on reviews and price. Upon unpacking, I noted that the exterior enamel coating appeared to be very durable and had a nice texture, nicer than the travel mugs we own already. The lid also feels well made and not brittle. It should fit into the car cup holder, clean up easily without having to use a bottle brush, prevent spills or leaks, and it's not breakable. Winning on so many levels. So imagine my surprise when after thoroughly washing the parts and placing it on the counter next to the blender, my loved one poured their smoothie of dubious pairings straight into a narrow glass bottle again. Maybe I'll keep it for myself?\", \"When I buy a cup for about $ 30, I expect perfection - no less.In terms of keeping the drink warm - it's fine but not really a hit.I used a thermometer to check. When I filled the water in the morning their temperature was about 90 degrees Celsius.After about three hours the temperature was about 60 degrees Celsius. This is a drop of 30 degrees. I was expecting something better.If you drink your coffee with milk then it cools down even more.But the bigger disappointment was that when I put the cup in my bag, standing of course, in case of displacements there is a leakage of the liquid out through the lid of the cup - which is really, really disappointing.I returned the product back.\", 'Solidly built and does not sweat. Unfortunately it ends there. It does NOT hold 20 oz as advertised. Won’t even quite make it filling it to the brim, which of course means you can’t put the lid on. It also does not keep things cold/hot more than a couple of hours, despite the advertisement. There are cheaper containers that do hold their advertised 20 oz and keep things cold/hot 12+ hours. If you’re into premium brand names, go for it with the above caveats. Otherwise look elsewhere.', \"Ordered this as a replacement for a broken (diff brand) hot beverage holder.  This fits underneath my Keurig single serve cup machine.  Keeps morning tea hot and then when I rinse and use it for water later in the day it keeps that cold.  Lid doesn't really have any issues with leaking unless you turn it upside down or sideways for a period of time--so not really leakproof but overall use works fine.  Love that is one of those that is dishwasher safe and doesn't require hand washing.  Will purchase again.\", \"The lid is not a screw-on and not very secure, I can easily push it out with one finger;  Not completely leak proof - it may not spill if you knock it over, but it will definitely leak if it's being bounced around in your purse.  The lid is also not a durable polymer-like material like most mug lids -  It's a clear plastic material that seems like it would break if you dropped it on a hard surface.Conclusion:  I found superior 12-20oz thermos mugs that are half the price and are guaranteed to be completely leak-proof in your backpack, purse etc (though I have yet to test this guarantee). I don't recommend this product for this price at all.  Definitely not quality that I expected from a reputable company like Yeti.\", \"I got it so that I could drink from a .5 liter soda bottle (16.9) without my drink getting warm over time. It does this extrememly well and I like it and all, but the amount of liquid in one bottle maxes out the tumbler's capacity with the lid on.  I can't put any ice in it beforehand or else I can't get the lid on.  I can't say they are lying about it being a 20 oz tumbler, it will hold that much without a lid on it, but I do feel that that is a bit disingenuous.\", \"For those, like me, who put off buying one of these(for years) keep waiting. I knew it was too good to be true. It does NOT hold your coffee hot for longer than the off brand, I got as a gift, from Walmart. Not good to pay over $30 for an $8 worth travel mug, I'm sending it right back! Btw, I work, and the lid was closed for long periods, and only opened to take a sip. It wasn't opened all morning, so it should of held the heat well.\", \"I love these! I was given one for xmas and decided that I needed another.  They keep your drinks cold for much longer than a conventional glasses while they aren't leak proof, I've knocked one over.  I was able to pick it up quickly and have just a tablespoon of liquid spill out. They also keep your carbonated for much longer. GREAT FOR SOMEONE WITH EXTREMELY DRY MOUTH!!Put in the fridge first for long enough to get it nice and cold then put your drink in (NOT IN THE FREEZER).\", 'The Yeti 20oz Rambler is well constructed...the Mag Slider Lid is easy to use and gives you a more coffee cup drinking experience.  I was concerned about the lid being a compression fit...it works well...so far.  Why did I not give the Yeti 5 stars.  1)  I compared it to my 25 year old starbucks double walled 16oz mug...the Starbucks would keep my coffee hotter for at least 4 to 5 hours...the Yeti is in the 2 to 3 hour range.  That being said...everything out there is being built cheaply...so this would be expected.  Finally, the rambler is really only for people with big hands.  I wear an extra large glove size...so I am able to grip it firmly.  Oh, yes, it is way overpriced.  It should be sold with the handle at $30.  Personally, maybe4 18oz would have been a better size.Would I buy another...100% yes.  I really do love it.', 'I use a water bottle all day everyday and take water every where with me. It took me years to buck up and pay nearly $30 for a Yeti because it just seems awfully expensive for a water bottle/cup. I finally did it though, & my only regret is not doing it sooner! Yeti definitely lives up to its hype. I love the magnetic slide top that you can remove to wash and clean. It’s dishwasher safe too! No funky tastes like other mugs/bottles. Sturdy and sleek design. And drinks stay cold for hours on end (this is my favorite part)! Well worth the price, in my opinion. Highly recommend if you are looking for something durable that is quality constructed and insulated (I’ve yet to put anything besides cold water in it but that’s just because I prefer to drink water over anything else).', 'I didn’t want to spend the money but after breaking several of the ceramic coffee mugs w cozy and lid I decided to spend the money.  My coffee stays hot all morning at work.  Sometimes if I’m busy and don’t get back to it til afternoon, it’s still warm!  Love it, spend the money.', \"Oh gosh, I hate to give this 4 stars because it's a great mug.  My old coffee mug finally wore out and I ordered this because it said it kept beverages super hot for a long time.  That's what I expected, however, although it keeps them hot longer than other mugs I've owned, not as long as the one I just threw away that was so old the brand had worn off so I couldn't order it again.  This one is adorable looking in brick red though, I like the size and everything about it.  I would still like to find something that keeps my tea hot longer though.\", \"I like water. This contraption holds water very well. I put cold water and ice cubes in it and then drink it with my mouth. It's a real treat when I'm thirsty. It arrived via UPS with a small dent on the bottom. I did not like that, but there are no other issues. I bought the canyon red Yeti because I like the color very much. If you like drinking liquids, I think you will like this contraption. I paid for this contraption with my own money and was not paid to review this contraption.\", 'I bought several mugs, and hated them.  Most have complicated leak-proof lids that are really hard to keep clean, or the drink hole is so small you burn your mouth trying to get a sip of coffee.  The Yeti closure is attached by a sealed magnet, so it simply pops off to drop in the dishwasher, and the design is perfect for drinking.  Keeps coffee hot for hours, fits in my car.The size is perfect for me, but, it might be too big around for some people with small hands (like my wife).P.S.  I was worried about comments about knock-off versions.  I can confirm that I received the official real product from this seller.  Hope that helps!', 'THIS IS NOT A YETI!  It LOOKED great- but wait and use it a few times.... Errr.... I am returning this. I have issued for a return. I do not have original packaging because this was a Christmas gift. My son used it 3-4 times. IT RUSTED on the inside!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He works outdoors in extreme cold. Not sure why it rusted. A YETI WOULD NOT RUST! According to merchant return policy they will ONLY refund if in original packaging and new/unused condition. WELL... This had better get refunded. Scammers. We will see,', \"Very glad we paid the extra $ to get the Yeti brand. Keeps ice cold all day even in hot car. Keeps hot drinks hot of much much longer than my store brand coffee thermos.

Highly recommend.\", \"I contacted Yeti before making this purchase via amazon to make sure it's an authentic Yeti.  I received the 20 oz rambler in the mail today.  I registered it online and also called them on the phone for it's authenticity.  100% legit if you order directly from amazon yeti, auth.  I would avoid third party sellers in case of fakes... plus amazon works with yeti so you'll get it in 2 days or less.  The rep on the phone via yeti was nice as heck and we talked for a good bit.  5 stars.  Again, make sure you buy it directly from YETI via Prime for 100%.  Also register it on the yeti website for 5 years warranty!  It did come with the magslide & Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.  Buy this rambler!\", 'I love these cups or maybe the lid and this whole magnet closing top making cleaning them a lot easier than any other traveler we have. It’s awesome. I have gifted many of these and highly recommend. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️', 'I purchased a Tervis 16oz tumbler but was disappointed that it does not keep my Ice water cold for long so I purchased this 20 oz Yeti tumbler. It is the perfect size and my ice water stays cold without the ice melting like the Tervis did. The primary issue I have with the Yeti is the clang it makes when you sit it down since it is steel on the bottom. For a whopping $30 you would think Yeti would come with a padded bottom. You can buy Yeti self sticking coaster bottoms for another $8 but you should not have to. I made a soft bottom out of velcro strips (fuzzy side). So that problem is solved but it still rubs me the wrong way.', \"This is leak-resistant, not leak-proof, and it will definitely leak if left tipped over. That's not a deal breaker for me, and otherwise, it's the absolute perfect travel mug. Keeps drinks hot for ages (pro tip - fill it with hot water while you're making you're coffee to preheat it, and it'll last even longer) but the outside (except the metal lip) stays cool to the touch.It has a nice, heavy weight that is comforting. I know this sounds weird, but some of you will understand. Coffee isn't just a drink sometimes, it's a break, a time to calm down, etc.It fits in all the cup holders. It's cute. It GOES IN THE DISHWASHER - best news ever. I just recommend rinsing the lid after the dishwasher, as the slide tends to hold a bit of dishwasher water and the smell/taste can interfere if you're picky like me. A 2 second rinse fixes that, though.\", \"I started making coffee at home and so this is perfect for it. I love that it keeps my coffee warm and the mouth piece is easy to clean. My only complaint is that it's kind of hard to hold. It gets slippery sometimes, maybe after some time using it, it'll get better. I also have smaller than average hands. I left it in my car trunk one time with a drink inside and it leaked, so the lid isn't leakproof (at least, the one I have :() I was sad to learn that, but it's okay, it still keeps my coffee warm.\", 'Only issue: Unlike other thermal cups, at first this one took a short time to get used to - it dripped slightly when I sipped. I quickly adjusted to it and it is now my \"go to\" travel mug.', \"Not really sure what all the hype is about Yeti mugs. I bought this one because a lot of people were raving about how your coffee stays hot for hours in this mug but I didn't find that to be true. I brew my coffee pod directly into the Yeti, add a small amount of cream & put the lid on. I drive 20 minutes to work & take my first sip once I get there. Honestly I would say my coffee is just warm,by no means would I say it is hot. My Contigo travel mug  keeps my coffee warmer than the Yeti. I find it heavy & clunky,not really worth the price which I didn't mind spending if it kept my coffee HOT!!Addendum: Today I poured boiling water into the tumbler, put the lid on for 5 minutes & let it heat up. I dumped the water & immediately brewed my coffee pod into it, added cream & out the lid on. The coffee stayed hot for ~45 minutes max. which is enough time for me to drink it all . It doesn’t seem logical to me to have to “ heat up” a $30.00 travel mug but I’ll do it so that I can enjoy my coffee while it is still hot.\", 'Please consider other products if you are seeking a \"leak\" proof product....this cup leaks and is not anywhere near spill proof and/or leak proof...I read the comments and I looked at the number of people who liked it....I have found that the reviews with one and two stars are sometimes the most reliable views to be taken to heart. I failed to adhere to them and now I am back to shopping for another cup and sending this one back. Yeti is way overrated in my opinion and they are very expensive. So I may buy another cup, one that might leak just as bad, but at least I will not have spent nearly as much money.', 'My favorite part is the magnetic slider in the lid.  I am 6’5” tall … I’m tellin ya I have large hands.  The 18oz Yeti is a bit large to get my hand comfortably around.  Any bigger around and it’d be a giant “NO.”  I bought my wife and two adult daughters the smaller one … perfect to hold, but I think it’s only 12oz.  I also had my wife’s engraved by YETI.  A nice touch.  And it’s pink.', 'Today was my first day to use my new cup; I was excited because my last two travel cups leaked and didn’t keep my morning coffee hot for very long! I got to work and about an hour later my coffee went from hot to warm; then another hour later went by and it wasn’t even drinkable. When I got home I dig my $12 cup out of the trash and sent the Yeti back. What a mistake! I guess I’ll keep looking and researching.', 'Senior citizen with prostate and bladder problems. Primary physician says drink lots of water.

The mag slider is really what puts Yeti mugs above all others because they’re so easy to clean. Gasket around the lid comes off fairly easily for cleaning too. Don’t forget to clean this - they get yucky. Love the navy blue. Some reviewers say they have trouble with the lid leaking around the edge. I just don’t fill my cup up to the very top. And I drink my coffee cold so I’m not sure about heat retention, but it sure does keep mine cold. Genuine Yeti goodness. I haven’t bought into their coolers yet but touché on the $30 mugs.', \"I recieved my Yeti SS tumbler as a gift a couple years ago and was amazed how well it held the temperature of liquids.  Hot things stayed hot!  So when my wife mentioned her old thermal tumbler was worn out and did not hold the temperature very well,  I took the opportunity to buy this for her and was thrilled when the color available perfectly matched her new car.  She was thrilled and very impressed not only with the color but how well it does its job.  The top with the magnetic slide works very well and is easy to clean.  My old tumbler lid did not have a way to close it,  so after seeing this lid,  I bought myself this same lid for my Yeti tumbler.  Great product,  however if you put a liquid in really hot,  you won't be able to drink it for a while since it holds the temperature so well.  I usually am driving when I use it,  so to keep from blocking my vision I slip a silicon straw through the slot and CAREFULLY sip.\", \"This mug is AMAZING!

All around sturdy and awesome cup', \"We've had lots of mugs, but this is top quality materials and workmanship. It keeps water cold all night with a few ice cubes and the lid. The seal on the lid isn't waterproof, but not advertised to lay on its side. It fits perfectly in a car cup holder. We also bought the handle which is also sturdy, simple, functional and good-looking. The paint is high quality, we love the deep red color, this should last a lifetime. The 20 oz size is big enough without being bulky. The vacuum is very efficient to keep cold or hot. Sure, it's somewhat expensive, but is replacing all those other inexpensive, fragile, ineffective mugs we used until they failed.\", \"What can I say: It's a Yeti, and it absolutely works as advertised. It's unfortunate that Amazon sells some colors at far higher prices than others (over $50 for a cup?), but I guess that's business. Had everyone but me discovered that the slide-closure-style top uses a magnet? After weeks of use, I accidentally noticed that the sliding part simply pulls off for washing underneath and easily refits because it's magnetic. (There is nothing mechanical about it.) Brilliant, and I'll be lots of buyers (like my wife) haven't discovered the secret.\", \"Yeti makes some wonderful mugs that are absolutely worth the money, my commute often lasts up to an hour and an untouched coffee will stay fresh the whole way. The excellent insolation however means no external dissipation, so don't expect to warm your hands by this mug.It's not spill proof but if you're buying a mug intensive on it's ability to be knocked over repeatedly, insulation is likely the least of your problems. Good mug, buy it.\", \"This is not the product for you if you define travel coffee tumbler the way I do: place in the side pocket of my back pack, in the console of my car, with no worries of leaking.

I still use it because it keeps the coffee hot but I now take less coffee to work to avoid a mess.\", 'As far as cleaning and maintaining the temperature of the drink it seems to be great. However the problem is it doesn’t keep the drink in it.I’ve tried several times with different types of drinks and different temperatures but it always spills. I’m a student so caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, and energy drinks are a daily drink for me. However be it in a cup holder in my car or in the bottle holder on my backpack any sort of slight swaying caused a the contents to spill out of the top while it is shut. The first time it happened I had an energy drink in it and it got all over my backpack. I though maybe it was the pressure from the carbonation that was causing it to leak from the slight sway of my backpack walking through campus and upstairs. The second time it happened it was iced coffee while I was driving.I don’t know if I got a faulty one (I doubt it) but honestly I wish I bought something else.', 'I make just one cup of coffee first thing in the morning for someone but cannot predict when that person will drink the coffee. This Yeti will keep the coffee drinking temperature for about 3 hours.  It looks good but not sure it is that easy to hold.  I love the lid because it is not a threaded closure.  When a warm liquid is poured into most thermal drink containers the threaded closures expand and make it difficult to open.  This one just has a rubber (silicone?) ring around the top and you can just pop the top off. Great for someone with arthritis. If you turn it upside down it will leak a bit from the drink opening, not the lid.  It works very well for my purposes', \"I got a YETI for Christmas last year .

Him, because he loves his coffee cold and me because nothing keeps my coffee hot like a yeti!

This taupe color is also lovely!', 'I live in the AZ desert. Insulated cups are an essential item. I have a cupboard full of them: bubba, ozark, beast, etc, etc.Here’s the thing: they all do what they’re supposed to. Many of them do it for much less money.The Yeti is my favorite, and my daily go-to. Here’s why...Lid: the magslider is great. It’s easy to use, opens with a thumb flick, is leak and spill resistant (more on that later), seals great, and is easy to clean. I’ve bought magsliders for other non-yeti brand cups because they’re that good.Finish: yeah, it’s pretty hard to beat. Hot, cold, wet, dry, bouncing along on a back road... grip is great, looks great, and is really durable. Doesn’t dent with normal use (like some of the others I own). Top notch.Does it really work, though? Heck yes. As good or better than the competition. No fear of leaving it in a hot Jeep in the AZ sun and coming back an hour later to still having ice water.Leak-proof? Honestly, what do you plan to do with it? If you’re carrying it around, knocking it over, putting it in your car and off-roading - yes, it’s not going to leak. If you fill it, turn it upside down and shake it - it’s going to drip. Don’t think you’re going to fill it and put it in a backpack. Don’t be a fool.I have others that really don’t leak at all - but they require 2 hands to open and are impossible to clean 100%. The Yeti is the best mix of leak resistance to ease of cleaning and operation.Overall: look, I use mine daily. All day. Every day. You get what you pay for - but be careful, buy from authorized dealers only, even on Amazon. Knock-off tumblers are all over, and there are differences. I splurged on the Yeti and immediately tossed several of my cheaper ones (I honestly have a dozen of these things) right into the Goodwill box. Recommend 100%.', \"After purchasing a couple of metal insulated tumblers by different companies, I finally bought a YETI. Well, you get what you pay for. The magnetic lid is so brilliantly designed it makes me giddy! It slides easily, keeps spills at bay, and is the easiest thing to clean EVER!! Did I mention it was a brilliant design? I know it costs more, but you'll be glad you splurged. The cheap ones will likely kill you due to the bacteria that gets trapped in the slider part of the lid. You can never get those things clean. I would put this design up there with the guy who came up with Post-It Notes. Yea, it's that smart!\", 'Super impressed with this tumbler by Yeti. First of all it is dishwasher-safe whereas several other brands of tumblers of this type need to be hand washed. That was almost enough for me to consider buying this. The magnetic closer on the lid is a work of genius. The best part about this tumbler is that it truly works, like all Yeti products, keeping what you want cold cold for a very long time and the same for hot liquids. Highly recommended!', \"After hearing so much about Yeti, I took the plunge and purchased a 30oz rambler for the husband, this 20oz rambler for myself, and a mug.  I love the construction of the rambler.  I can put ice in a drink at bedtime and the next morning the ice is still there.  Put a room temp beverage in your Yeti, then put Yeti into the fridge, and the drink remains room temperature.  I couldn't be happier with the rambler.  That being said, the lid leaks, a lot.  I was quite surprised to have a leaking lid from a company of Yeti's reputation.I found out the hard way when my $300 Brahmin bag got filled with water from the leaking lid.  I checked the lid on my husband's, and it leaks too.  I was hoping to add drink and protein mixes, then shake, but it's not meant to be.  So 5* for the rambler and 1* for the lid.\", 'One of my biggest complaints is how my coffee maker doesn’t make my coffee hot enough to stay warm and I typically have to “chug it” or heat it up again before I even finish one cup. Now, when I pour my coffee directly into my Yeti, it is piping hot for hours. I now understand what all the hype is about ! I also use it for ice water at night and it keeps my ice cubes cold for hours.  I’m so pleasantly surprised by this cup, I’d buy it again. It is worth every penny especially if you’re particular about the temperature of your hot or cold beverages. It is very well constructed and is the perfect size too. It is definitely in a class by itself.', 'viene con todas sus etiquetas originales y lo puedes ingresar en la página oficial para validar su autenticidad. Son una chulada sobretodo para bebidas frías ya que mantiene la temperatura y hasta te alcanza los hielos para 2 bebidas. Lo otro que me encanta es que no suda el vaso lo cual también permite mayor comodidad así como poder sostenerlo sin congelarse la mano. Buenísimos!', \"Great cup, love the magnet shutter on the lid. Makes cleaning better and I don't have to worry about it breaking. The cup keeps your coffee hot. Overall it's a great cup.The tolerance of the bottom edge of the lid vs. the metal top of the cup is too big. The lip on the bottom of the lid sticks out past the cups lip so when you take a sip sometimes a small amount of coffee drips down, I sanded the lid down to improve the tolerance but that is my only very tiny complaint. Not a big deal.\", 'This was like the most trendy item......don\\'t know why, it\\'s not worth the money. I\\'ve used Thermos travel coffee mug for years. I can toss it into my car or purse and NOT A DROP comes out. It\\'s also the most extremely hot holding mug. The only problem for me is the gasket which allows you to open/close gets worn I believe. I thought I\\'d opt for Trendy Yenti. Well if you actually go back and read the info, it DOESN\\'T SAY LEAK PROOF ANYWHERE ON THE SITE AND/OR WHEN YOUR MUG COMES IN. Well mine leaked. For $30 I just went back and got a new Thermos again. Mine was like 6 yrs old. Not bad for $17. Oh and I returned the Yenti. Also one of the reviewers of this mug called the company and they said,\"IT IS NOT LEAK PROOF!!!!!', 'i know these seem stupidly expensive for an insulated tumbler but with yeti you get what you pay for.  I freaking love this thing.  It keeps my coffee hot for HOURS in the morning and I like my coffee, like, one notch down from scalding and it takes a long time for the temp to drop to a level where I am not enjoying it 100%.  Trust me, this thing is worth every penny.NOTE:  it is NOT lead proof.  if its super full and you giggle it around too much you will get a bit of coffee on top of the lid but since my commute is from my kitchen to my home office its a non-issue for me.', 'Very disappointed in this! I bought this based on strong reviews online because I needed one that I can plunk in my tote bag with my sweater, lunch box, water bottle and files — and maybe some knitting — that would not leak and that would keep my coffee piping hot all day. The first day I took it to school, having carefully pressed the lid and valve closed, took out my sweater, and it was soaked with coffee, as was everything in my bag. Who knows if the coffee was still hot? It was all over all my things. I am returning this. The cautionary tale is, be careful to read the descriptions- Yeti does sell a thermos with a SCREW-ON lid, as opposed to the PRESS-ON lid on this one. If you need one that don’t leak, don’t buy this one.', 'I love the Yeti brand and own several. They are always my go-to for gifts, which is why I was super disappointed that this arrived damaged. At first I thought it was maybe just paint or something and I could scrub it off, but this was AFTER using a couple different cleaning products. The bottom is all scratched up too. I still love the brand, but the quality control needs to be better, especially for the price.', 'The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Kind of disappointed because not long after using this, I found that I have rust inside my cup. It’s pretty good for the most part- keeps my drink cold and lid is secure but you’d think I wouldn’t have to worry about rust. I’ve purchased cheaper insulated cups before but got this to see if it was really worth the hype and honestly, aside from the really secure lid, the other less expensive brands basically do the same thing.', 'I bought my husband one for Christmas and he used it that day to go work outside. He poured himself some coffee around 5am and when I came out to let him know to eat breakfast, around 10am, he didn’t get to drink the coffee because it was like he just poured it in! He loved it!!! Definitely great quality and it definitely holds its temperature.I should add it was one of the coldest mornings/day that day.', \"I've had my rambler for over a year now, and wanted to give a review on it's quality after strenuous use. It is great. It can easily keep coffee hot for 5 hours, to the point where it's still too warm to drink. I have the magsafe lid for the rambler, and while it's not 100% leak proof, it does prevent liquid from escaping when it's in a cup holder for example. I also don't know wether or not it is officially dish washer safe, however, mine has been washed in the dishwasher exclusively since I've owned it with no issues.\", 'The tumbler came without the top lid. The company told me to get it from Amazon. Amazon told me to get it from Yeti.', \"I LOVE 😍 YETI!! It keeps my coffee fresh & Hot. It is totally leak proof and way easy to hold. Omg besides keeping my coffee hot which is number one, it is super easy to wash. I bought this one because I previously bought a Yeti tumbler mug. I can't see how I've lived without it.\", \"I love my Yeti mug.  Not a big fan of the company for their political views but I digress.  These mugs are easy to clean and drink easily from (unlike some others that pour out at a trickle).  The magnetic slide closure on top is genius and makes cleaning the top super easy.  Only downsides are it weighs more than some other, similar sized mugs on the market.  Also, the top is held on by the friction of silicone seal rings (unlike some others with screw on tops).  If you drop it, the top may pop off and spill your drink all over the tile floor, onto the carpet, under the wood trim...not that I've ever been so careless as to drop one of these...\", 'The slide on the lid (magnetic) leaks. You would think that this would be a no-brainer design requirement. \"Need a lid that does not leak\". Apparently Yeti thought it was OK if the drinking slide leaked.Not for me.I have two other insulated, stainless vessels. One for coffee and one for water (when hiking). Neither leak at the lid. Might be OK for in-home use but since it leaks there is no way I am taking it in a vehicle. Also wondering what happens to the lid the first time it slips out of my hand and lands on the tile floor in the kitchen.', \"Just got it. After checking out some YouTube videos on what to look for, this appears to be a genuine YETI.  I really like that I can take the slider off, and thoroughly clean it and the surface it slides on.The only downside,  which I can't fault YETI  for, is that it doesn't properly fit the cup holder in my 2011 Tacoma.  Yes it goes into the holder ,but unless I VERY gently place it back in the cup holder,  when I go to pick it up again it brings that half of the cup holder with it. I knew it would be close. Oh well.\", \"Purchased this as a gift and friend told me that it doesn't keep his hot drink as hot as long as he expected.  I had given him a non-Yetti previously and he actually stated that kept his drink hotter longer.  Because product isn't being used by me I still give this high ratings.\", \"I have arthritis in my hands, the tumbler is heavy and large making it hard to grip.  I ended up picking up a Yeti handle for it thinking it would not make a difference, but thought I should try, oh my it did! I recommend picking up a handle also. Makes a good difference.I use the tumbler daily. It's nice that it's leak proof since I take it back and forth to work. I like that it's easy to clean too. I felt I over paid for it,  I wanted the 20oz. And the pink color. Had been waiting for a few months for pricing to go down but it didn't so I bought it anyway.\", 'I like my cold drinks VERY COLD and my hot drinks VERY HOT and this has given me the ability to keep the liquid that way while I am drinking it.  Not sure why they warn DO NOT PUT IN FREEZER.  I will abide by that, but I often put my other vacuum bottles in the freezer and have done so for years. If there was a liquid in between the walls it would expand, but not a vacuum.  Hmmm?', \"I just got and was so excited to find a American made product as I did some research and from what I read thats where it was made. That's mainly the reason I purchased it. 1st disappointment. It's NOT made in America. It was DESIGNED in Texas but made in China. I put it in a pocket in my backpack and the top leaked some. As to weather it keeps things hot or cold for extended periods of time that remains to be seen\", 'I ordered from the Yeti authorized distributor and delivery took several days. The mug appears to be a well made product though pricey. I would expect, with its design, that it would leak if turned on its side so the lid design is not an issue.', \"Are Yeti products over priced? Maybe.. Are their products really good, Absolutely. It's a treat and you deserve it. After I bought my first Yeti 3 years ago.. I now have 4 different Yetis in my household. They are sort of like Apple or Tesla products, they stir passion among owner who swear by them.Finally, this King Crab I got is absolutely lovely. The color is just right, not as light as peach but not hot as the sun. Of course, the Tumbler itself is flawless. :)\", 'I love this Yeti Rambler.  I’ve been using the Yeti 32 oz. cups for a while, but I wanted something smaller for my morning coffee.  I’m so glad I tried the Rambler!  It keeps my coffee hot all day if I keep the lid on and the magnetic slider closed between sips.  It’s very easy to clean the lid because the slider is just a magnet that can be easily lifted off.  Also, the lid’s rubber gasket can be easily pulled off by sliding a fork tone under it and lifting it out of the groove.  I was so impressed I got two more Ramblers and gave one away as a gift!', \"Looks like a great cup (would have been my boyfriends first Yeti), but I ordered camo and received black. The sticker even says camo. Pretty poor quality control. You would think SOMEONE would notice the color was labeled wrong before it shipped out. I'd like to order again but don't want to deal with having to return another one if they are all black cups labeled camo... Pretty bummed.\", \"I love this product - we weren't expecting it to be fully leak proof because that's not how it advertises itself.  We expected it to be spillproof in our stroller, and that it is.  The magnetic top thing is AWESOME - it's a joy to use, it makes an awesome little snap back and forth.BUT - I'm appalled that it markets itself as 20 oz.  We overpaid on our coffee for a week before realizing that the thermos fits only exactly 16 ounces if you're actually going to screw the top in (and, aren't you?)  I can't understand how they're marketing it as a 20.  Go get your measuring cup and you'll see for yourself!\", 'Best cup ever. I fill this with Ice in the morning.. and my drink stays cold to the bottom. I’ve left it on my nightstand overnight, and still have a cold drink with ice in the morning. (Plus) I’m ensured the cat won’t have drank from my cup, or dumped it. ♥️', \"This product leaks a lot!  I thought I was getting a premium product by buying  YETI.  NOT AT ALL.  It didn't keep drinks Hot for long either.  I am sending it back.Could NOT recommend this Yetti product -- or any other Yeti product based on this experience.I had a Contigo insulated tumbler that I had for 20 years.  It worked extremely well -- COULD NOT RECOMMENDhot things stayed very hot for many hours and it NEVER LEAKED.  Found it again on Amazon and ordered two.  The price was very good -- especially compared to the Yeti!  I KNOW the CONTIGO WORKS!\", 'A Yeti is a Yeti and it works fine to keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold. However I wish I had gone to a store and actually held one in my hand. If you have small hands or are 74 years old with arthritis in your thumbs, you will find this tumbler difficult to hold.My second observation is that when they say 20 oz they mean filled clear to the top. Don’t try and put 20 ounces of liquid in and then put the lid on, is not gonna happen!That said, it’s a good cup for most, for these old hands I wish it had a handle.', 'I like the Yeti tumbler.. it does keep things hot/cold for a long time… I don’t like the back splash through the top I get sometimes but that is here not there.. I bought a handle for it and it slides right off if I don’t want to use it.. I got this cup for a fairly decent price but normally these Yeti products are terribly expensive for what they are.. this will probably be the only one I have..', 'Got this to help me drink more water (as I like cold water more than room temp.) It keeps water cold for around 8 hrs (my standard work day). For other reviews that complained about leaking… I genuinely believe they don’t know how to use lids or don’t know how to drink from cups. This is a really expensive, adult sippy cup. Not rocket science. Just a cup with a lid. And it’s great.', 'The ice does melt during a day at the beach even under umbrella and or in shade. Ice lasts much longer in my home. Basically, no different that cheaper models I have purchased. You’re just buying a name.While I love white, my lipstick gets all over the white. I don’t use straws.The magnetic closing mechanism works great. Had in cooler on its side for most of the summer and it never leaked.', \"I am in LOVE with Yeti!  I've never had a coffee container that keeps coffee hot the way this one does...it's amazing! I almost never use regular coffee mugs anymore.  This tumbler is also dishwasher safe which makes it super easy to clean.  And, I love the color!  It's totally worth the money. But...the lid is not leakproof. So if you must have a leakproof lid this one isn't for you.  Otherwise, it is near perfection. I also have the larger 30 oz. Yeti tumbler that I fill with ice and my favorite cold drink and it seriously stays cold ALL day. In fact, the ice is still in the cup the next day.\", 'It is able to keep hot drink hot very well for a good duration.  Was concerned about easily losing the magnet-based slider lid before purchasing it, but that stays on quite well and is nice to take it off the lid to clean both the lid and the magnet slider piece.As specified by the manufacturer, it is not leak proof, but the slider lid is still nice to have in avoiding a larger spill when the tumbler is tilted or tipped over if the lid opening is closed with the magslider.', \"Got this for my wife and product meets description in every way we have come across! While we haven't tested the cold as long yet, the hot drinks stay piping hot for hours - to the point that my wife said she can mix up and still drink her coffee plenty-hot 2-3 hours after the gym and commute, which is 4-5 hours after brew.On top of that it arrived on-time and was spotless, very good looking scrambler! Got my wife the sea-foam to go with it and myself the maroon since we don't like sharing. 5 stars and would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a great all-around Tumbler with multiple lid-options with the added plus of lots of fun colors and a standard-for-the-REI-market-price to match.\", 'no seams inside to collect mold. love the cover easy to clean, like it clear to watch for mold.  holds my 12 coffee with creamer, no problem. perfect well worth the price!  added a slip on handle works well with it.  i have seen some concern over spilling but it seems pretty well sealed to me,  if you drop it the cover may come off.  but overall LOVE THIS MUG!', 'I don’t know what people can find to dislike about this product. I filled it up with coffee at 8:30 am and at 1:30  pm it is still perfectly drinkable. If I do have a complaint it would be that they should warn you that it keeps hot drinks really hot. The first time I used it, after it was filled for an hour, I assumed it would be lukewarm, but it was still so hot that I  burnt my mouth. I assumed that the YETI brand was all hype, but this is a very nice travel mug. Well made, no tinny taste and easy to use. Would I pay $200 for an ice cooler? No.  But, this product is worth the money.', \"I scoffed at my friends who had Yeti this, and Yeti that. I thought it was mostly hype because I've had other insulated mugs. Well, I'm a believer now. If you put ice cubes and water in the mug on a summer morning, then sip away all of the water, don't expect the remaining ice to melt that afternoon. I could get a pile of ice cubes to chill multiple refills of water until the next morning.\", \"I bought my husband his Yeti after he broke his glass coffee tumbler. Well, he loved it because it kept his coffee hot all day at work. So I bought myself this one because I wanted to keep my water cold all day at work and it does. Now my husband wanted one for home on the weekends so I bought a third one. They fit underneath my Keurig no problem but large enough to hold two medium cups of coffee from the Keurig. It also holds a can of soda with lots of ice. I've dumped it over twice and with the opening closed it did not leak. Very durable. My new Christmas gift idea for others. So many colors to choose from too. I highly recommend them, but only the Yeti.\", 'I am going to be honest, not sure why people are complaining about this cup? I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves this cup. He mainly uses it for hot coffee. It is super well made and cleans easily. Doesn’t spill unless you over fill the cup, but come on… I do like the fact that the lid is a magnet so I can take it off easily and clean it. Definitely would recommend to someone who knows how to properly use a cup.', \"This is not my first yeti product and I have loved everything from them. Buy this tumbler gets 1 star from me! Within the first month of use I noticed my water tasted bad.  I saw small spots of RUST on the bottom of mug! Now I'm trying to figure out if I can still return.\", \"I’ve heard great things about the Yeti brand. The jury is still out.Keeps my coffee hot. I like the look, size, feel and aesthetic of the cup and lid. Haven’t tested it to see if it leaks- I’d be surprised if it didn’t.One thing that concerns me is that it says it's safe to go in the dishwasher but after only a month, there’s a noticeable change to the inside of the cup. I’m not going to bother to post a photo for you, but I am considering sending it back...\", 'Figured it was a “yeti” so I’d see what it could do. Well...not to impressed. it’s a nice cup..sleek..easy to hold and dishwasher safe. Besides that there’s really no difference from a 10$ Walmart version. Side by side the ice lasts just as long in those. So if a name brand isn’t the selling point I’d save the 20& or so and go with a knockoff brand', \"I'm really happy with my Yeti mug, works great, keeps my coffee hot, and it's easy to wash. I almost gave it 5 stars for leak-proof, but I did tip it over once and it only leaked out a few drops. So I can't say leak-proof but certainly doesn't leak much.I found out about one really nice feature I wasn't aware of. I was rinsing my mug out at work and the lid dropped on the floor. The closer over the drink hole fell off, I thought that I had broken my new mug only to find out that it was magnetic. I was very pleased with that. Plus it's easy to really get the lid clean. and I can put the whole thing in the dishwasher.\", 'I bought this to replace a Contigo that I had lost. Yeti is a good brand and I figured I’d try it out. It has to be similar to the Contigo.Nope.Tried it with coffee and just laid it on it’s side briefly with the drinking hole closed and had leaks at the opening and around the sides. Additionally it doesn’t keep your coffee hot as long as a Contigo does.The best thing about this is it’s dishwasher safe which my Contigo is not.I’m sure people who love expensive brand name Items love this but I’ll go back to a Contigo and stick with the brands I know and trust.', \"I think I will really enjoy this Yeti Rambler tumbler, but getting a complete one has been a little frustrating.

Yeti's quality control is far from perfect.PS--Added 10/9/19 today I received an email to return the item.  I would have returned it immediately IF Hannah had mentioned that to me.

Well, this \"20 oz\" tumbler only has a working volume of 16 oz up to the bottom of the lid and perhaps 20 oz to the very brim if you remove the lid.  So what good is a coffee tumbler without a lid? not much.  If you want a travel mug that will hold more than 16 oz, buy something else.  This is false advertising by YETI.', \"I liked everything about my Yeti except when the MagSlider lid is closed, it leaks when tiled or turned over.  This may be the way it's constructed, so I won't be tilting it over unless I accidentally drop it or knock it over.  It doesn't keep my tea hot as long as I expected but I do drink from the Yeti all day while doing things.  Maybe I was expecting too much since I sit it by nightstand at night although it's still slightly warm in the morning.\", \"I actually drink water now! This 20 oz. Yeti is the perfect size to hold while walking to work, not to bulky or heavy. I fill this up with cold water and ice several times throughout the day.

A little pricey at $50 bucks, but worth the buy to keep me drinking water and being healthy.\", 'I love this thing.  It keeps drinks hot or cold for a very long time, and one of the things I like best is that it is wide enough to put your entire hand in there with a sponge or cleaning cloth and get every speck of the surface area inside totally clean.

There is just one problem (and quite frankly, it's a rather big problem). The magslider lid that comes with the Rambler is one of the worse lids I've ever used. Yes, it does slide open and closed smoothly, however, it leaks.I live in WIsconsin and I drive a truck for a living so rough roads are a normal part of my drive. Every bump, every tip, and any movement by the truck or Rambler the lid will leak around the closed black slider. And forget about laying it down or tipping it at all.It is quite frustrating that a great product (and a rather expensive one) cannot make a lid that does not leak. Because of this, I can't say I'd recommend the Rambler to a friend, so long as it comes with the Magslider lid.\", 'I got the 20oz Yeti cup for my boyfriend as one of his gifts for our anniversary because he kept talking about it!

I also took a drive and left it in the center console of my care on a very hot day.  8 hours later out in direct sunlight, there were still some ice cubes hanging in there.  For whatever reason, the ice water tastes particularly good as well.  This has really helped me realize a goal of getting a gallon of water in a day.  The mag lock can get lost - suggest ordering extras and then you have some color flexibility.', 'I picked up 2 cups just like this as gifts for Xmas and liked them so much I went out and picked up one for myself, it’s nice but for the cost it could have rubber on the bottom, and a edge to form a vacuum to stop it from falling over, the lid is one of the best but if the cup falls over my coffee ran out of it. The other this is this, this cup will keep ice for days inside of but with that it’s a benefit and a drawback, because if you would like your cup in your bedroom to have a nice cold drink in the middle of the night don’t expect the ice to melt to offer that to you, if you drank everything in it before laying down', 'I am very disappointed. This cup dribbles every time I use it.  Have tried cleaning it and making sure the rubber seal is in place and it still drips when I drink.  Yeti is 2-3 times the cost of other similar cups and for the price it should work.', \"I got one for my husband from a store. He was so happy with it, that I ordered one from Amazon for me because the store didn't have the color I wanted. Now I understand why he loves the mug. It has plenty of room and keeps hot drinks very hot. They do cost a little more, but I think they are worth it in the long run. Also, the seller was very helpful.\", 'This is my second, left the first in a plane seat pouch when I was distracted traveling with a cat.  It goes where I go, keeps water chilled if that’s how you want it. I like that it fits in most cup holders.  When carrying it in a backpack pocket it did leak at times, hence 4 stars. But my water cup and I are a pair.', 'We really like both the look and function of this travel mug.

It is easy to clean, holds a good amount of coffee, and fits in the car cupholders without any problems. It is not a \"throw in your backpack\" type of tumbler, but a good \"set it in the cupholder or on the desk\" type of travel mug.', 'While I like the tumbler over all, keeps my coffee hot, I hate that liquid constantly bubbles up through the closed mouth piece of the lid. Not a great seal if my beverage gets out. If this a bad lid or does this happen to everyone else? It\\'s not filled to the brim, either, but at least a 1/2 - 3/4\" below. Disappointed in this.', 'This tumbler is a good size - it holds more than a large mug, but fits in your hand comfortably and also fits in a normal cup holder in the car.

If you LIVE for HOT COFFEE, this is the YETI for you.  Pour in your favorite brew, and an hour later, still hot!!!

Amazon is shipping out a replacement.Update: I got the replacement and it was in perfect condition. It keeps drinks cold for a long time. I put ice water in it before bedtime and it still has some ice left in it in the morning. I would recommend this tumbler.', \"While it does work in keeping your drinks fairly warm or cold, I've had $15-20 tumblers from other companies that have kept the temperature consistent for longer. Also, the lid only does a slightly moderate job if preventing leaks. Of course it's not advertised as leak proof, but you would think for such an expensive product that they would have made the lid leak proof or at least make it more leak proof. If you accidentally knock over the tumbler with the lid on, you will definitely be cleaning up a spilled drink.  While the smooth finish and sturdiness of the tumbler itself feels nice, the whole thing is just a little too big to be able to comfortably grip it (I have medium to large sized hands).On the plus side, the entire cup and lid are dishwasher safe, which I will say is a very nice bonus over other brands.Overall, I'm not overly impressed.\", 'I bought this tumbler specifically because I have tried several other brand and no matter what the slide on the lid would always get mold grow if you did disassemble the mechanism.

I put them through the dishwasher with no issues.  One thing to consider is how large your grip is.  I'm not super petite but I find it a little uncomfortable to hold particularly when my hand hurts a little a bit from excessive keyboard use (common ailment).  I will probably buy one with a handle for myself eventually or find one that tapers more at the bottom. But it's really good at doing what it says it does.\", \"You pay little more than another one in the market but the difference is clear. It feels like it is made of quality materials and though was put into it. It is not leaking proof though.

I would have thought it would have kept that tiny amount that's always left hen you finish a drink but it managed to get out. Overall great product\", 'I bought this one as a gift for my husband. He later got one for me.  We use them daily.  They are expensive, but they should last pretty much forever.  My husband lost the little magnetic black part because it is removable for cleaning. Fortunately, yeti accessories are sold so we replaced his lid.  Since, we have discovered that instead of removing the magnet piece you can rotate it 90 degrees it still sticks.  This give access to the parts you want to get clean but without separating it from the lid to get lost.', \"Bought a new coffee maker and i wanted a nice thermal tumbler to go with it. This one was perfect!!! Comes in alot of nice colors. I bought the gray. I also bought the handle (sold separately) and it works perfectly. It's a sturdy handle.

We will  not be purchasing another lid, time to move on to another brand. Did anyone ever wonder why they offer replacement lids?', 'Because the lid easily slides on and off for convenience it’s not as effective as some other Yeti products. It holds plenty of coffee and keeps it hot for a little while but friends have told me hours later their coffee is dangerously hot in their Yeti travel mugs. Not the case here at all. I make certain my coffee is much much hotter than I like it for drinking when I full the cup. It will hold heat a couple of hours, but not really much longer than that.

It\\'s better suited to use while driving or sitting at your desk.  There are plenty other leak proof options out there if you need that.  I subtracted a star for the cost.  This is basically a Chinese-made, double-walled, 18/8 stainless cup that can be found at around half the price from other brands.  You\\'re paying almost twice the price for the \"Yeti\" label so I would probably look for a similar quality tumbler in another brand.  The only label that I\\'m willing to pay for that kind of markup is \"Made in the USA\".', 'My favorite cup for any beverage. I take this everywhere and use it everyday. Mainly use it for cold brew coffee. I fill it a 3rd or half full with ice and it’ll still have the ice over a full work day. The lid design is amazing and easy to unlock for quick sips. The only issue is that it may leak a little if left upside down. Other than that it should be fine. I’ve dropped it and also left it in my backpack bottle holder while traveling and it didn’t leak. Would definitely recommend this for coffee drinkers especially.', \"I love my 20 oz. Yeti Rambler. This time I bought the Brick Red one, but I have several others -- 2 for warm drinks and 2 for cold drinks (what could be better?). I love that they have fun, collectible colors.I personally am a klutz, so I require the handle made for this tumbler. (Each and every one of my Rambers has its own handle.)If I am allowed one small criticism, it's that Thermos has a vacuum sealed lid that (no kidding) will let me put a full container of coffee in my purse and not have a disaster! I wish Yeti would implement something similar for their Ramblers. Their lids are good, but they are certainly not leak-proof.That said, I love my growing Yeti collection.\", 'So I did a test today. I have a black car with black interior and we are having a record heatwave. I put ice and iced water from my fridge and left it in my car while at work today just to test it and guess what?! It was 103 degrees at 1:30pm when I went out to my car and I still had ice! So I am very happy with my purchase. $30 Is a lot to spend on a car mug but have to say it was worth it. I am a real person living in Livermore California. This is not a bogus review!', 'This Yeti was purchased to replace an all-stainless Steel one that my wife had used for about three years.  Coffee stains were making the old one look bad.  This one came and was a great replacement.  It looks great with the classic color and handy spill-proof lid.  She’s loved it.  It fits in the cup holder in her car and you see it in her hand a lot during the day.  I have a hard time getting it from her to wash for another round of fresh, hot coffee.  This is a great Yeti product.  It keeps coffee warm for a long time.  Cold stuff can be kept cold too.  Often ice left in it will still be there the next DAY.  This is a great cup.  Buy it.', 'This does not keep drinks hot as long as other options out there, and it’s certainly not leakproof. If I’m walking to my car with a somewhat full tumbler of coffee, it leaks out the top. It’s nice-looking and easy to clean, but not worth the money. I was reluctant to buy it in the first place and am frustrated that I wound up actually making the purchase.', 'I bought this for my wife, and her only \"complaint\" is that it keeps her coffee too hot for too long.  When she pours her coffee, she leaves the lid off for about fifteen minutes to let it cool down first.  Under normal circumstances, you could consider this mug to be \"leak-proof,\" in the sense that you could drive around on bumpy roads all day with this thing in your cup holder and you wouldn\\'t spill a drop, although a little bit might pool on top of the lid.  Just don\\'t try throwing it in your gym bag and expecting it not to leak.', 'I was really to spend $$ since it was YETI and I was confident of its quality.  The magnet lid....  NOT spill proof.  Even when the lid is closed... it leaks. I am very disappointed.  The 20oz size is just too big to hold onto as a medium-sized woman.  I am waiting for the holder to deliver. If not, I cannot hold it.

It's petty I know, but when you have a large family and you want every have their own cup, it's hard to know who is who's when the colors are the same!  It was the main reason that I was willing to pay double to avoid this!±!+±+3\", 'Love the cup and how its designed for dishwasher safe. However the lid keeps leaking and its annoying.

It keeps coffee and tea warm a wonderfully long time! How did I manage before without this? Seriously superior to any other insulation mug over tried before. This is it for me!!

I do not know why I waited so long! I am in love. When you receive it, it has all the tags and sticker on the bottom of cup for registering your YETI. Be warned not to rip that off right away until you get the number to register it and it comes with directions in side the cup on how to do that as well as a free YETI sticker. As far as the cup goes, it is amazing, keeps my coffee cold all day long. I put ice coffee or water in it and it has stayed cold with the ice for 24 hours so far. Very easy to rinse and clean. I also read that you can order different lids with straws without having to order another YETI if you choose. Highly recommend.', \"Wanted a fall/winter color and it's perfect.

Actually Bought this because I lost the lid to my Other Yeti Mug and Currently Lids are Not Available to be Purchased Separately.', \"THIS IS A GAME CHANGER! It's cute, leak-proof, no sweating, so SO easy to clean and the best part, truly insulated. I live in Costa Rica and visit the beach quite often, and I got this since I hated to drink warm beverages while I was staying there, my other tumblers didn't hold up well and whatever I was drinking always got warm right after arriving there (and the ice melted in minutes). My Yeti rambler held my ice cubes FOR 12 HOURS in the costa rican weather, which is hot and humid! I put it in my purse full of liquid and it never spilled. It's so good that I got one for everyone in my family, and they are hooked too! My mom takes her coffee there and it never cools off, she has to take out the lid for a few minutes in order to star drinking it otherwise it keeps the temperature. Seriously, BUY THIS.\", 'The best period, update-I have dropped my Yeti 3 times and once on steel plates. It held up with no visible scratches. I am impressed. It was thrown out of my hands when my driver braked really hard and it did not spill. 5 stars, best ever. Never drinking coffee from another rambler brand ever.', \"I really love my Yeti tumblr.  I wanted something that was easily cleaned, travel size, and sealed with leak proof top.  My cats have a habit of dipping their paws in any open containers of water I have.  Nothing is sacred.  I would say the Yeti meets my expectations for the most part.  Even with hand washing daily, it can start to get a moldy smell after a few weeks, so I would say use the dishwasher once every 2 weeks.  It is generally leak proof, but if you hold it entirely upside down, it will have a few drops of water come out.  Do be careful and make sure the magnetic piece is closed on because I've forgotten several times and leaned over slightly to have it spill all over me.  But overall, this is what I was looking forward.\", 'I bought 4 of these. Yea 4 of them. To have different beverages in them while I’m on the road. I used for Protein Shakes as well. After the second use I noticed a terrible smell when I open the lid. I ran it through the dishwasher atleast 10 times and the smell wouldn’t go. Hand washed it’s still there. I soaked overnight with hot water and it just wouldn’t go. I’m really disappointed and wouldn’t recommend for drinks other than water and coffee.', 'I love my Yeti tumblers. they keep thing hot or cold as needed. they come out of the dishwasher looking brand new. they are really well made and useful, I have heated soup at home in the morning and kept it in this and hours later it is still really hot.

This is the perfect size, weight, and material for her.

Yeti quality is undeniable!', 'I wish I could give 6 stars. I LOVE my Yeti!!! I bought a tumbler lid and straw separately. This cup is perfect for smoothies. You do NOT get the nasty taste of the smoothie melting and separating. Nope. I can make my smoothie at 8am, put it in my Yeti, and it is still cold, perfect, and delicious even at 5pm. Downside is the same with hot drinks... they stay HOT and do not cool down unless you take the lid off LOL. So I have to ask Dunkin to add a few ice cubes to make it a more drinkable temperature. Otherwise it’s hot forever! Not a bad thing, it just shows how well it’s made! Well worth the money and I plan to make another Yeti purchase soon!', \"I wasn't drinking enough water at work, I have a very busy physical job that doesn't allow me to just leave whenever I feel thirsty, and I hate warm warm water, so I let that slide. Enter the yeti! I can fill it with water and ice and it stays cold ALL DAY LONG!! I can refill on breaks and drink at my leisure, no more excuses for not getting my water in. I have had someone knock it off my desk, it survived no problem and it's easy to clean as well. I love my yeti. It is pricey but, let me say this, it is well worth it. Treat yourself to a yeti, you will not be disappointed!!\", \"I've used Yeti products in the past and I love how it keeps my coffee hot. My biggest problem is the magnet lid doesn't work properly. Coffee seeps out of the lid and makes a mess before I even realize. Severely disappointed.\", \"Love this cup! No leaks thankfully, and love that it's made out of metal too. Don't worry, can't feel hot or cold (depending on the drink inside) so that's always good. Also, usually use for coffee going to work and haven't had it stain up like some tumblers do after many times being used and washed in the dishwasher.\", \"Yeti, while a tad on the expensive side, provides an unparalleled drinking experience. While not as leakproof as some of my Contigo purchases of the past it is exceptionally easy to clean and the mouthfeel during drinking is *chef's kiss* amazing. Does not pour super well but does make up for that by providing great insulation (as long as you close the slider too) and beautiful scratch proof coating on the outside providing life-long color.Overall very pleased with my purchase and this is the second one I own as I received my first as a gift.\", \"I'm extremely disappointed in this first Yeti purchase. I live in the outdoors, on a farm, and my first trip with my new Yeti tumbler resulted in hot tea splashing out of the top of the cup through the closed lid and onto my truck.

This thing will keep your drink hot or cold all day and doesn't dent easily like other insulated brands.

Sometimes though I do bring it to the coffee shop when I get coffee because it keeps my coffee hot from 7:30 - 11:30 a.m., which is amazing.  It has unfortunately leaked on me a couple of times from the lid, which seems impossible because it's so tight.  It also can be so tight sometimes that when I have to apply a decent amount of pressure to get the lid off, sometimes causing the coffee to spill and also makes me think I might end up ripping the rubber seal off one day.

I like the magnet lid, but it leaks so you can't let it tip or turn over if you are planning on putting the cup in a bag. It does keep liquid hot for hours and I do like how easy it is to clean.\", \"I've always been told, that you get what you pay for.  Sure, these tumblers are more expensive than most others BUT they're worth every penny!  I have arthritis in my hands and don't have a problem holding the tumbler, opening the slider on top or taking the lid off.  I will never buy any other brand again.\", 'Arrived intact, on time, and looking great. It was a gift and my wife, who has used a succession of mediocre car-cups, is VERY happy with her Yeti. Note: she hasn’t had a leaking problem, but as I understand it the company markets it as more “big-leak-resistant” rather than “leak proof,” so I don’t down-rate it for that. We’re happy!', \"I've added another Yeti to my collection =)I've found their quality to be impeccable; the magnetic lid effectively prevents spills, their coating enhances your grip, the insulated cup effectively keeps warm drinks hot/cold drinks cold, and it just looks really darn good.And they have a 5-year warranty on all of their products - what's not to like?\", \"I purposely waited at least 6 months before writing this review. I was on the fence about purchasing after reading the reviews because it appears that this particular product maybe a knock off. Well, I can safely say it is not a knock off. It is the real thing. And they were amazing. I bought two and they are used DAILY.  You can shop with confidence. These products are the real deal and the company's reputation speaks for itself.\", 'This light blue is beautiful. And i can tell it’s very durable material. The top stays on well but is not super difficult to remove. Makes for easy cleaning. I bet this cup lasts a long time. I like iced beverages and i live in Florida. My tattoo artist actually told me about this cup lol. I have to take meds with OJ and my cooler doesn’t keep my OJ very cold so i bought this to keep it cold. Excited to test this out!**update: tested it at the pool in the sun for FOUR hours of Florida sun and heat and my ice is still solid!', 'I’ve been spending more time at the beach 🏖 lately and one thing I noticed was that once I open my drink I always had to quickly drink it because it would always end up getting hot . A friend mention the YETI products and I came across the 20oz cup. I can tell you is a game changer for me now, my drink stay cold ALOT LONGER and the cup size is perfect.I would strongly recommend this with out any hesitation, is worth every penny.', \"Ever since trying it out, I've been using my wife's Yeti Tumbler on a regular basis. I love that it keeps coffee hot for hours and the design of the lid is very simple and easy to clean. Getting the green one for Xmas, which matches the color of my car, was one of my favorite gifts this year!\", \"The lid of my Starbucks hot fluid container finally broke apart after 10 years of daily use. It kept my coffee hot for 8 hours, then warm for another 16, so for 24 hours it was reliably warm. Went online to order a new one, and Starbucks doesn't sell such items online anymore. So I talked myself into believing that this YETI item with is super duper double whatever would keep my coffee hot similar to my Starbucks container. NOT. It's cool after 4-8 hours and was a tremendous disappointment. The vendor here at Amazon did fine, it's not their fault that the YETI product doesn't measure up. Now I'm out $30 or so which I could have used to buy something else that might actually work like the great and wonderful Starbucks product.\", 'I was hoping this would replace my aging Camelbak travel mug, but so far have been disappointed.  This mug is kinda fat which makes it difficult to hold and get in and out of a cup holder while driving.  The seal is not as tight as the Camelbak and the beverage does not stay hot as long.  I have stopped using it as a travel mug and only use it when I am at home and it is fine for that purpose.  Disappointed and will probably not purchase again.', \"The review is for the middle Yeti. As you can see, I'm a fan of Yetis. I bought this one because I was gifted the smaller one but it was too small (it fit one coffee pod but no room for cream/sugar) and it didnt fit in cupholders. This new purchase is the perfect size and it fits into my car cupholder. I've had my water bottle for 2 years without and issue and it keeps my water cold for hours, even when sitting in the sun. This coffee cup also keeps my coffee warm for over an hour - and probably longer (without having to close the mouthpiece)\", \"I'm so happy with my Yetti cup!  I put ice in my cup in the morning and I still have ice in the evening.  It never leaks water on the tablets and I use with a metal straw and it's ice cold every sip.  I couldn't ask for anything else to keep my water cold.  I never leave home without it.  Perfect size.\", \"I've had this tumbler a few weeks now and I usually use it for water only. I have had coffee in it ONE time from about 9am to 12pm when I finished it. (yes, it keeps beverages both extremely hot and also nice and cold for long periods of time).Since then, I have washed it numerous times and no matter what I do, I cannot get the taste or smell of coffee out of it. I've tried the baking soda and water and let it sit over night, mult dishwasher runs and hand washing as well. Nothing will remove the smell/taste of coffee and it makes my water taste god awful. Also, this cup has tipped over and even though the mouth piece is closed, water leaks everywhere. Will be returning.\", 'I\\'m not sure how they call this \"leak proof\". It certainly is not. The top leaks. I ordered 2 and initially returned 1 because it leaked from the opening where you drink from. Yes, I closed it all the way and IT STILL LEAKS. I got a new one and it leaks also. So now I retuning both.  If you are toting this anywhere, like I do in my lunch carrier, don\\'t tilt it at all or you will have a puddle of coffee. NEXT!', 'I have different brands and the Yeti is best. It gets the fewest stains, the handles work the best in the YETI', \"The product is great, this isnt our first Yeti, so no complaints there.  Now as far as delivery, shipping was faster than expected, I'm happy about that too, as this was a second one for my wife so she's not taking mine when cleaning hers.  The delivery drive placed this on and behind our pumpkins on the front porch, even the photo that they took seems like it was tossed there.  However same delivery they put lawnmower blades in my mail box. Luckily this isnt something that could be damaged easily, but why place it with my kids pumpkins whether tossed or placed.\", 'I liked this product but unfortunately it was huge and wouldn’t fit in my car’s cup holder so I had to return it. I returned it on 1/31, within the vendors return timeframe. It’s now 2/20, not only have I not gotten my refund, but it now says I never returned it. I will be contacting amazon directly since I assume it is a problem on their end, but my main review is this- this is a good looking tumbler and clearly very sturdy, just be careful if attempting to return it!', \"This tumbler is great.  It keeps cold things cold (haven't tried hot drinks yet).  20 oz size is nice.  The only problem I have is that I have small hands so it is hard to pick up sometimes.  I recommend buying the handles from Yeti as well.  Once I received those, this became my favorite new purchase.\", 'I switched all my thermos cups to Yeti, except I have 1 Lifefactory I also love. They are much more easier to clean, making them more sanitary (this is attributed to the lid as there are no inner parts to the lid that I cannot access in order to clean which was my problem with a lot of other brands. The Yeti lid is flat with just a rubber o-ring making all the parts accessible to clean), they are durable, and keep the temperature of whatever beverage is in there.', 'I placed this order on December 12th. It was supposed to be a Christmas present. At the last minute I had to run out and try to find one. I do however, have another Yeti and I have always found it easy to clean and my coffee stays hot all morning. I like the design of the mug as well. Fits in my cupholder great. The tracking info now says that it is on the way so one can only hope.', \"I read a lot of the reviews and had gotten a bit discouraged to buy this. But I took a chance anyways and I'm glad I did. This thing is awesome! I use it at home only and really only for cold water or iced tea (it's summer afterall) but it keeps things cool for quite a while. I've had no issues with leaks or anything I read in other reviews. I plan on buying my son one too\", 'Rip off. My $14 Contigo mug doesn’t leak this much, and it keeps ice frozen longer and is easier to hold. Unless you have a super huge mouth, your drink in the Yeti, is going to spill on you when you drink from the slot. It’s very tricky to use. Maybe not a huge problem if you’re drinking water....but not for hot drinks, or any other fluids. Going to try to return it as the moment it flops over on my bed, or, in my briefcase...everything gets soaked! For this price it’s a rip off.', \"It's heavier than expected as I'm used to a  light weight tumbler.  Not very friendly on arthritic hands.  It gets heavier after adding liquid.  Also, the color is not as bright as in the pictures.  I expected it to be more of a pink fuchsia, instead it's just a regular pink mug.  Too bad the purple was twice the price, which I could not afford. However, the lid is amazing, it won't leak.  Ice lasts overnight.  The ice will melt if you leave the tab open, but other than that it is very amazing quality.  Updated review after a few days of use:  I put ice in a 1pm and it still had ice at 8am the next day!!!\", \"Since having another baby I stopped carrying around a cup of water because not enough hands. I bought this size to fit in the outside pocket of my diaper bag and it is a good fit. The color is bright and cheerful. The lid isn't quite leak proof, more leak resistant, when turned upside down only a few drops of water come out. It keeps water cold even when sitting overnight.I ended up returning  this one because of a dent in the side which was likely due to being shipped in an envelope. Return was easy and I have already recieved the replacement.\", 'Be warned: I ordered two Yeti mugs from Amazon and both of them were shipped without the mag slider, as advertised. I had to contact Yeti, directly. Thankfully they were understanding enough to ship the mag slider free of charge, but bad business, Amazon! The mug is pretty much a huge pain to deal with without the slider…the top is completely open and unable to be covered…', \"These things are awesome! Keeps my coffee hot for hours. Bought it because Dunkin' when from foam to paper cups and they leak all the time. I ride a Harley and this is no good.  would get coffee all over me and the bike, but not anymore!\", \"I needed another Yeti and wanted one where I could close the lid.  I was so excited to see this one had a closable lid.  It holds the cold water in pretty well, too!  But then I dropped the lid and found the magnetic part flies off so easily.  Another time, I dropped the whole cup at night outside, and then the magnetic part snapped off and I couldn't find it again.  So I ended up having to order a whole new lid to get one that had the closure.  I can't find where to order just the magnetic slider.  I'm trying better not to drop my cup now.  I'm not sure if there's a way to design the sliding closure so it can be easily cleanable, but not at risk of being lost if you drop your cup in a dark parking lot, like I did!  A plus for this review is that when I've dropped it, nothing has broken!  Just the magnetic part popping off, which is a bother, but everything else has done great, even when dropped on tile and concrete.\", \"Receive this cup Aug12, sending it back Aug 17th. It has the name Yeti in it but it doesn't do what a genuine Yeti does. I have a Yeti cup that I have had for years but I just wanted another one, now I'm going back to my old one. What about this cup I don't like, it doesn't keep my ice, I expect some melting but before my 8-hour shift is over my ice is melted and my drink is watery. In a genuine Yeti cup, this does not happen.\", \"Love this tumbler.  The lid is smooth and comfortable to drink from.  The magnetic close is ingenious and each to remove to clean.  Liquids stay really cold.  The cup fits in car cup holders.  Grippy AND attractive outer coating so it doesn't slip from your hand. Totally worth the money - I am now hydrated!\", \"Yeti never disappoints, and the price on the 20 oz. Tumbler with lid really can't be beat, I couldn't give any less than 5 stars.Coffee stays hot for hours with the lid closed, and I've had ice last in cold drinks overnight in this cup. It fits under my keurig (with the tray removed), in the cup holder in the car, and it's easy to clean. I ended up buying 3 as Christmas gifts. Definitely recommend.\", 'My wife loves this thing! As clumsy as she is, she says it’s the best leak-proof cup on the market. And believe me when I say she’s tried a bunch of them.Typically I wouldn’t buy a name brand item such as this because they are overrated and over priced, but I can say that this purchase has been a pleasant surprise. As tight as I am and as many reviews that I read and the research I do before I make a purchase, I’m impressed and I’m typically not impressed with much!Yeti, you’ve won my love with this one!', \"I got the teal one for my mom for christmas and she LOVED it. Yeti's are the best in general, and getting her first Yeti she was so excited. Its on the spendy side, but sooo worth it. My mom loves her coffee and bloody marys. This is perfect for all cold and hot drinks. Also, I loved the color!I think I might just need to order another one for myself.....😉\", 'I was looking for a smaller cup that my giant one for work. I needed one that would fit in a pool float, for travel, and stay cold. I also needed the flexibility of being able to use with or without a straw.100% success and zero complaints.', \"I've never had such a bad coffee cup before.  It literally spills coffee from the opening and it goes everywhere. I've been skeptical of bad reviews, but this is literally the worst purchase I've made in my life!\", \"I had heard good things about the Yeti cooler, so, I thought I'd give this mug a try. I'm very disappointed in this mug. It keeps my coffee hot for, at best , two hours. I expected that it would do that job for at least four hours. I like the lid and how easy it is to open, but, I suspect that since it is plastic this is the reason it doesn't do a better job at keeping the coffee hot. So far, nothing beats a Stanley.\", 'I was worried about the fact that some reviewers appeared to receive a knockoff product with the wrong type of lid that was poorly insulated, but the one I received (ordered May 2019) is the legitimate product as pictured and described.Some reviewers seem upset that the lid is not \"leak proof\" and in fact the rating asks me to rate \"leak proof\" as a feature, although the product does not advertise itself as such, and by simply looking at the product you can see that \"leak proof\" is a somewhat ridiculous expectation. If you hold the tumbler upside-down while filled with liquid you\\'ll get a few drips out of the mouthpiece, but you should really probably expect that as it\\'s a plastic lid covered by a magnetic sliding piece - at this point there is no serious seal. The o-rings around the lid make a tight seal and the lid comes on and off easily while remaining snug enough to feel very secure.I have used the tumbler for a few days, filling it with ~165° F black coffee at about 6:00 am - the coffee is still hot and probably about the same temperature at 5:00 pm, although it usually doesn\\'t make it that long! The mug is a little heavy but is comfortable enough to use and fits nicely in the cup holder of a VW GTI. There is good texture and grip.', 'This is the best thermal cup I’ve ever owned.  When I pour my coffee in the morning, Black, 2 hours later it is still so hot you have to sip not gulp.  The top seals very well and under normal use you would not get a leak, but the drink door is not bullet proof and if you turn it upside down or put it on it’s side it’s possible to get it to drip.  The sides appear to be painted and although not shiny smooth could use a little more texture for gripping.  Over all I love the cup and would immediately replace it if lost or stolen.', 'I love Yeti products. This is the 5th yeti I’ve either purchased or had purchased for me. I love how they can keep drinks hot or cold for extended periods. My only real complaint is that cold weather seems to negatively effect the drink inside more so then does hot weather. I can keep my coffee hot while outside on a cold day for about an hour. When it’s hot outside though, I can have my iced beverage in the metal cup in direct sunlight and it’ll keep it ice cold for 4-6 hours if not longer.', 'This cup looks great and really keeps my drinks cold.  The sip opening is big enough for a small straw to slip through - and even with the sip opening \"open\"  - my ice does not melt!  I do wish it was a little bigger - unfortunately, 20oz was as big as I could find for this particular shape/style.  No Matter - it is still my favorite cup!', 'The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0This tumbler is fairly easy to hold.

I’ll try out a cooler or two soon.', 'I am a reusable water bottle Queen. Camelbak was my first love (and still is the only water bottle allowed in my bed) and YETI is my last. Until they can make a YETI with a Cambelbak lid, those are the two products I will continue to buy.My water stays cold without ice easily for 6 hours with the magslide lid open. I dropped my yeti on the sidewalk pretty harshly and found out what the MAG stood for in magslider... it pops off for easy cleaning! Also, the bottle did not have any dents or scratches, only the lid did from that tumble. I love this thing. Great for beer & cocktails, coffee, etc. and fits perfectly in my cup holder in my car. 10/10 product, would buy again.', 'Save your money and buy anything else. I was so excited to receive this because all I heard was how fantastic Yeti products are. This one was was dollar store quality. The sliding mechanism on the lid was loose, so my coffee spilled out, and the lid itself wouldn’t suction closed, so it wouldn’t keep my coffee hot. It also barely fit in my car’s cup holder. I got the sea foam green color, which I liked, but that was the only thing I liked.', 'At first I bought my boyfriend the dark blue color and he kept talking about how amazing it was so, I bought one for myself in the seafoam green color! I can’t tell you how amazing My Yeti is to clean!! I can take off the magnetic part from the lid and completely clean it without worrying that I’m leaving bacteria in it. I’m considering buying another one and getting rid of my old to go coffee mug so I don’t have to run the dishwasher daily. Seriously amazing and a game changer in the coffee cup game!!!', 'Packaged just as a cup in a box not really anything to write home about - coffee from keurig to yeti (with warm cream) maybe around 150-160f - but after hour and half- cools down to under 110 - 90f - so not getting this entire so cool effect.  If it kept my coffee warm for 3-4 hours at 140f it would be awesome - but not an hour and half to lose half its temp.  Sorry, bought this because my other stainless steel was goofy to drink coffee from - but that would maintain at least 3 hours of hot coffee.  Sending back most likely - to expensive and large', 'My wife was given one as a gift a couple years ago. She wanted another one for traveling so I here we are. First time she used it, she complained she could barely hold it. Thinking she was just being her, one morning I made her a cup of coffee. I made it about halfway to the bedroom when my hand started to get uncomfortable. By time I made it to her, it felt like I had poured the coffee directly in my hand. I was able to keep a straight face as I set it on the nightstand, and when she asked if I noticed it being hot, I told her she was just being a wuss. SO,  Needless to say, she was right, as usual...... THIS IS  EITHER A DEFECT CUP  OR COPY CAT', 'Absolutely am a YETI cult member... these things are the greatest drinking containers EVER!

Always thought this product is great from all the people that recommended it but my husband’s tumbler only stays warm for an hour. He’s a messenger/courier which is the reason I got him this so he can have hot/warm coffee at least half of the day.  Again this doesn’t hold the temperature. Super disappointed.', 'The 20 oz size is perfect for me as I usually drink two 8oz cups of coffee at home. So with this cup I have more than enough room left to add creamer. It fits snugly in the cup holder of my vehicle. If you have too much liquid in it, and it splashes around when moved, it will leak out of the open/close tab. Mine doesn’t leak any other place. Easy to drink from and keeps hot liquids hot/warm for hours. It is easy to clean except (as with any Yeti) you have to make sure to clean the cap’s rubber seal really well as to avoid build up and bacteria development. I have a smaller Yeti cup whose seal is removable (not sure if it was designed that way or if it loosened with time) whereas this one is pretty secure, I don’t know if it comes off. If you want a quality coffee cup for travel then buy this one.', \"Not sure why I decided to finally buy a Yeti product, because they're expensive. But most of the reviews seemed positive so I wanted to see if it was as good as others say. Honestly, not very impressed. It doesn't keep my coffee hot for very long. I put hot coffee in it around 8am and it ends up being slightly warmer than room temperature 3-4 hours later. I've owned others that lasted for 6 hours or so (for half the price). I have yet to try it with cold stuff.\", 'My husband and I both have Yetis. They are remarkable!  We love hot tea, and our tea stays hot for hours.  The first time we used them, the tea was still so hot two hours later we started laughing.  Some kind of magical insulation.

My wife received this as a gift and is very happy with it.  Because of the design of the top, it will leak if tipped or held upside down, but that fact is included in the product description.', \"Absolutely the best coffee tumbler I've used. It keeps the coffee hot for hours - especially if I slide the sipping opening closed when I'm not drinking from the tumbler.  I drink a lot of coffee, so I fill it and take it everywhere I go.

The spill rate is very low but it's enough to create a mess.\", 'I held off paying for such an expensive Yeti; however, the reviews are correct. This is unbelievably well insulated and keeps things hot/cold for such a long time. Placing a few ice cubes in one day are still frozen the next. Not that it is completely necessary but it certainly gets the job done. Poor design on the top though as it certainly leaks any fluid if the bottle lays over in a bag or similar. That is my only complaint and warranted me to buy another brand with a sport top.', 'Yeti makes a quality product. Affordable price for a Yeti.

Ive used this tumbler for water at the gym, Ale around the campfire, and coffee in the morning. its been a helpful friend in the temperature control and accessibility of on-the-go travel. The mag-slider lid makes this tumbler nearly spill/leak proof but i still would not recommend taking this product filled in a purse or backpack, its meant to stand upright. while registering this product with the sticker on the bottom i had it full of water and had it completely upside-down the mag slider lid kept any liquid from escaping and proved completely effective. The reviews of this product don\\'t do it justice. I ordered this product and received a quality tumbler that is easy to use and clean and operates as advertised. I\\'d recommend this over others in the market due to its weight, feel, retention, and leak proofness. thank you for the quality product.', 'I like the lid with the magnet as it is easier to clean: however I don’t use it.  But even without the lid, this cup keeps coffee hot for all morning and at night when I put ice water in it, the ice is still there in the morning.  Amazing thermal retention.  Easily fits in a car cup holder.  But the best part, where most insulated cups fail, is the thin lip.  Coffee cups need a thin lip otherwise it feels like you are wrapping your mouth around a bridle bit.  This feels good when you drink.', \"Really like this to go cup. Mostly use it for hot coffee which holds the heat for a few hours only, I think they can definitely improve that but really AMAZING for cold drinks, it holds cold for more then 24 hours, the ice barely melts.Also super easy to clean which is a big plus since a lot of tumblers have some crazy mechanism in the lid which accumulates the fat from creamer and coffee and yoi simply can't clean it.\", \"Worst travel mug I've ever owned. If it tips over it will leak (a lot). I bought this thinking it would be a good replacement for my lost travel mug. Waste of time and money!!!

Very disapointed.\", 'Always pleased with YETI tumblers. I have found that they hold ice all day long and keep hot drinks hot for hours. I received one as a Christmas gift.

It just has a little slip for you to drink off of, but liquid can still get out (it has done this to me and spilled on me). Otherwise I like this since it's easier to clean (easy to sponge with large lip, dishwasher).\", 'Believe it or not, this Yeti did not work - would not keep beverages hot or cold, especially when compared to one we had previously purchased at a local Ace Hardware store.  The good news is though that Amazon took it back, no questions asked and with a full refund. I was able to simply and seamlessly return it via a local UPS Store who packed it. All I had to do was to hand it to the IPA associate.  Then went to my hardware store and bought a replacement, works fine.At least if something like this happens, Amazon will make it right.

It's also a bit hard to hold with one hand unless you have really large hands.  I learned the hard way when travelling on a bus with it..it just spills everywhere.  I should just get a thermos.\", \"I actually bought this as a Christmas gift. So I'm really hoping that it lives up to its name and reputation. I do love the color and size. And I'm sure my nephew will love it! My only complaint is the packaging. It came in a really large box, that was way too much for the product. Also there was a price on it in a very unfortunate spot. It was on the paper band around the tumbler it's self. I ended up taking the band off completely. Update; The tumbler was a big hit!\", \"We have looked for a travel cup for my dad's coffee for years, without success, until I gave him this. He loves the cap isn't a twist on, the top doesn't leak, and his coffee stays hot. He ESPECIALLY loves that it fits in his car's cup holder. He has let it be known that he wouldn't mind getting another one just like it.\", \"I always considered YETI's to be an unnecessary buy - comparing it to say a hydro flask product, could this be dramatically better? They have a great feel when you're holding them, and they keep the coffee extremely hot for a prolonged period of time. I drive often and am usually in the car for anywhere from 3-4 hours each weekend day, so I was immediately sold when I tried one. I now own 3 (a tumbler, 16 ounce rambler, and a large jug which kept coffee pipping hot on a 9 hour roadtrip overnight to New York) -  I now buy Yeti's as gifts for birthdays and Christmas. If you enjoy warm drinks daily - it's a must have!\", 'What can I say? This is an incredible product, beautifully designed, and so efficient that I actually burned my tongue and mouth 4 hours after pouring my coffee into it. Holy cow! I will have to use a less efficient travel mug for the time being since I like to drink my coffee within the hour. BUT I can definitely highly recommend this product for anyone that needs their liquids to stay hot (or cool for that matter) for a very long time. Stay safe!', 'Love how long my coffee stays hot! It was a total surprise as most cups promise that, but don’t live up to it! Almost burned my tongue…Easy to wash, just tossed in the dishwasher. Cheaper cost then Yeti website…all in all a great buy!', 'This is my 1st Yeti and I was expecting a lot more from it. However, with this type of lid, it barely keeps coffee warm for an hour.  My contigo does a better job, but it has a screw on lid.  Anyhow I am sure many of their products are superior but this is not one of them.  I do love the color and texture however.', \"Ok so yeah, you don't want to hold it upside down cause it will leak. Main thing I was looking for was a cup that keeps the coffee hot while I'm sippin on it. This cup does a great job of that. Also wanted a dark green to match my truck. This cup has that too. Overall, I'm happy with it. It does what I need it to do and looks great.\", \"As like all Yeti products it is high quality product that keeps your liquids cold or hot for hours, but if you are looking for a leak proof cup, this is not for you. I would say it is more leak resistant, especially if you are able to right it in a few seconds; I knew this before I purchased the product, so this wasn't a deal breaker. I do like the magnetic lid, it is easy to clean and seals quite well, just not leak proof. I have tried other competitor products, Contigo Autoseal, but prefer the Yeti. The Yeti is a higher quality product that does a better job of keeping liquids the right temperature, it is also much easier to clean, due to the larger opening; the Contigo is a bear to clean and it isn't completely stain resistant. Overall I plan to purchase another in the near future.\", \"I bought this because a few coworkers said it really stood up to it's name, and WOW! I fill this w/ water and ice and tuck it in to my saddle bag on my motorcycle, literally right above a double exhaust pipe, and I kid you not I have ICE COLD water all day!  I'm buying another one!  My only issue with it is that if you shake it or hold it upside down it will leak out a bit.. so I have to always keep it in a plastic bag, but that's on a Motorcycle, in your car it sits upright so probably no issues with that...

I rinse it first in a little hot water to help it keep its heat, but that’s not really necessary. It’s very sturdy and easy to clean. I had a Bubba mug from Walmart for many years that didn’t leak at all. I wish this one wouldn’t drip when it's closed, but it definitely does. FYI, compared to the Bubba, this is (not surprisingly) an otherwise better mug.

I drink water all day every day, and I was tired of my ice constantly melting, so I decided to upgrade. This cup is hardly any better than the regular, off-brand, much-cheaper options in my cupboard. The ice does not last and I find myself exactly where I was in my search. My husband is a loyal YETI guy, and said perhaps they lowered the quality of their materials. He was surprised at how quickly my ice melted. I'm disappointed and don't know where to turn now if the king can't deliver.\", 'So, I love the design and the minimalistic elements of this. I like that it is easy to clean. But beyond that it seems to be a bit of a dud. The tea I had in it was losing its temperature by about 3 hours in. My other issue with this tumbler is that it is stated to be 20oz, but when I poured a 500ml bottle of water into here, it was filled up to the lid. I feel like the name is the major cost here.', 'I have used these tumblers for a couple of years and I lost one at a coffee shop.  Immediately ordered two replacements.

Drank the whole thing and refilled with water about a half hour later, then totally forgot about it.  The next morning about 8 a.m. I grabbed the tumbler in order to empty and refill.

If that isn’t false advertisement then I don’t know what is.  Annoying pouring a drink in it and having to drink 5oz that are left from a 20oz drink...... if I had known these ran small then I would have bought a bigger one.... or maybe they could sell the product that they advertise????', 'I’m a little disappointed in this tumbler for hot liquid, but it sure does keep your cold stuff cold. The lid creates a good seal, but the slider lets liquid get through, so you definitely have to hold this upright for no leaks. The good part is that it’s dishwasher safe. There are definitely better coffee mugs out there if you want a no-leak option that keeps your coffee super hot for hours. If your a cold drink or iced coffee person, this is perfect, just don’t knock it over or it will leak.', 'I was riding my scooter with the tumbler jammed in what certainly is not a cup holder when it popped out and landed in the street. I pulled over and hopped off just in time to see it get absolutely beaned by an extended cab white F-150. The front tires went completely over it and when the rear tires hit, it squirted our like a watermelon seed and spun on end like a top potentially topping 1000 rpm but that’s just a rough estimate.

Meh!', \"I've been using knock offs for the longest time and after many years of replacing these knock offs with other knock offs, I finally took the plunge and spent money on the real deal. I'm not sure what took me so long to do so, because Yeti definitely holds up to their reputation. I'm more so impressed by how long the tumbler kept my ice tea cold after how many hours. I use the tumbler more so for my cold beverages, but it also keeps my beverages warm. You really cannot go wrong with Yeti, they're a big name brand for very obvious reasons.\", 'So I love this. It\\'s been my saving grace. I have an infant so it can ensure my coffee is always warm. I ordered one for my husband too. It doesn\\'t leak earlier. I am a wild coffee holder lol and I haven\\'t spilled it yet even after holding it almost sideways.  Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it doesn\\'t stay as \"hot\" as long as I expected. It stays pretty warm (plenty warm for me in the time needed it takes me to finish it)  but not hot. It doesn\\'t bother me bc I like it more warm than hot, but if someone is looking for it to stay as hot as it was when it came out of the pot it won\\'t. Otherwise I want to buy one of these for everyone I know lol!', \"I use Yeti's 20 oz tumbler for hot coffee only, so I can't speak for how well it keeps things cold, BUT I can tell you that this tumbler is way overblown. It keeps coffee hot, but for a much shorter period of time than what it boasts. Unfortunately, I bought off on the hype and paid $29.99 FOR THIS TUMBLER! Let me say that again, I paid $29.99 for a 20oz tumbler. Please consider carefully before paying $20 too much. YETI IS WAAAAAAAAY OVER PRICED!

Does not keep the coffee longer than any other insulated mug on the market and is expensive to boot. All hype. No substance.', 'This really keeps things cold. Ice is still in the cup 24 hours later. I also like the fact that you can put it in the dishwasher. I do find it hard to hold onto with my small hands. I solved the problem by ordering a rubber slip-on handle from another vendor.', \"I love my yeti! I don't drink a lot of coffee and it usually takes me a few hours to drink 1 cup in the morning. The yeti keeps my drink hot for hours. The only part that isn't leak proof is the mouth area. When traveling to work and walking into the building my drink will come out a bit from that area. Otherwise, the deal is great and haven't seen any kind of spilling from the rim of the lid at all.\", 'I ordered this item as a gift and it was missing the magnet lid. Amazon won’t send a replacement so I have to buy the magnet lid separately now even though in the description it says it’s included. Without the magnet lid this item is basically a waste of money.

I leave a few drops in it and place the cup in the lunch bag and they definitely spill out. Overall though good cup just pricy which I’d expect from the brand…', 'Keeps beverages hot for a few hours, definitely not 12.  Definitely not leak proof! Coffee comes spurting out of the lid opening, even when in the closed position, if you jostle it while walking. If you need a travel that can handle bumps on the road, this isn\\'t it. If you need something to sit next to you while you\\'re in an office for three hours, this will be just fine. Definitely not good for early morning \"gotta run because I overslept\" type travel, you might end up with coffee all over you.', \"Thought I upgraded from my Contigo mug to this. I definitely spent more, but it probably wasn't truly an upgrade. I like the size of this mug, it's aesthetically pleasing, and it's easy to clean. My coffee stays warm, but my big issue with it is coffee leaks out the mouth opening even when it's in the shut position. This makes it annoying to walk with. My old Contigo I could just throw into my bag even when it was full and it wouldn't leak, but I can't do that with this one.\", \"The top is leaky - it won't hold the liquid and will spill everywhere...I bought a Simple Modern tumbler and it is WAY better and even cheaper.

I find when I make coffee, sometimes I have to leave the lid off if I want to drink the coffee within 30-45 minutes of pouring it into the mug.

The gasket fits very tightly to the lid which can be a mild nuisance when cleaning it, but overall very satisfied with this product.

It stores the perfect amount of coffee for me and keeps it warm all day.  It fits my hand comfortably along with the drink holder in my car.  My favorite feature is the MagSlider Lid.

Hot drinks will keep temperature longer than a regular coffee cup but don't expect a hot coffee two hours later.

I love the cup I ordered it for a gift. But when It arrived it was thrown in a box with a vacuum I ordered. So the slider for drinking was I thought broken off her its just a magnet.

I first put very hot water in the thermos for 5 minutes  in order to get the thermos heated hot.

The top is nice and if it falls over you probably wont spill any at all.', \"This is a stodgy 'whatever' product.  It works well unless you want to clean the grungy top or seal.  When you drop it, and you will because it is too barrel shaped, has no reliable grip or grip space even though you will think it feels like it does, the magnetic slider will pop off.  Go find it somewhere in the leaves or under the concrete crack or maybe it slid into another dimension.  Good luck not splashing your drink now that the clown in the gutter has your magnetic slider thingy on top.\", 'I’m giving this one star because it doesn’t do what any basic coffee thermos should do: not leak. Held upright, with the lid on and the mag slider closed, my coffee consistently splashes up and leaks out the top through the mag slider.

I’m a teacher so keeping my coffee/tea warm long enough to drink it has always been an issue. This solves that problem.

Definitely recommend.', \"One would think a Yeti mug meant for travel is spill proof. It is not and Yeti confirmed this is not a feature of this mug when I contacted them after I purchased it.

DISAPPOINTED because I thought Yeti was one of the good ones, but I guess not.\", \"I really like the sleekness of the Yeti. It's great at keeping liquids hot or cold for longer than my other mugs.

Just like the old-fashioned thermoses we used to use for coffee, these are a perfect thermal cup to keep your coffee hot, or your cold drink cold. Love it!', 'Well this turned out to be a bust. I got sick of my Tervis tumblers lids breaking, so I figured I’d try a Yeti. They say they’re leak-proof and they absolutely aren’t, mine leaked coffee all over my backpack the first time I used it (and almost every time after if I wasn’t careful), and the sliding part of the lid is magnetic, which sounds great until it falls off and you have no idea where it is. Does not keep liquids warm for longer than a couple hours either. Upset I wasted $30 on something that totally does not live up to the hype.', 'Quick review here:Got my mug & have used it twice. First with hot coffee, next day with ice water. I like how sturdy it feels & how well the lid seals. It seemed to keep the cold liquids cold better than the hot liquids hot for the same amount of time.  My hot coffee was “warm”, but not hot after about an hour. With my cold liquids, I still had plenty of ice after 3hrs that had not melted. It was a little pricey & my main reason for buying it was to keep my coffee hot during work.  I don’t think I would purchase it again.', 'I was dubious having read the \"lid leaks\" reviews but took a chance. I\\'m very pleased that my lid does NOT leak and I love the lid\\'s design. Iced tea from dinner is still cold in the morning to take vitamins and meds with.

I\\'m most pleased and would reccomend this to friends and family.', 'I love this cup. It keeps my drinks cold for many hours.

The lid is also easier to remove than other travel mugs that I've used, which is a big plus.

However, he uses it to and from his teaching job and during the school day, so he keeps it upright in a cup holder or on his desk.  The important thing is that it definitely keeps his coffee hot for hours.

We are very happy with the purchase....now to get one for myself!!', \"Ordered this as a gift for my gf who kept spilling her coffee on her way to work. I wanted to get her a mug that would fit into a car holder but also can be used everyday around the house. Keeps hot things hot for hours. Haven't been able to use it for cold things as much, would definitely like to try it out at the beach. Overall great product, feels great to drink from.The lid is very sturdy and won't pop off suddenly. Not 100% leakproof though, when holding a cup of water upside down, leaks slightly through the seal. It would however prevent spills if knocked over on accident so no big mess to clean.Overall very happy with the purchase and would purchase again.\", \"It definitely isn't leak proof. The slide lid let's the hot liquid out of the top and releases the heat. The cheaper one I bought from wish has lick lid that I've dropped so many times and it's never broke or opened leaving my liquids inside.

Needs a lick lid.\", 'I was surprised that this YETI tumbler spurted my hot coffee up through the mouth piece while in the closed position. It is also heavy and wide and the finish is slick.

Did purchase the Yeti handle for it as well, excellent product overall.', 'Yeti is known for being the overpriced branded tumbler. But I will say, you get what you pay for. The build is solid and the lid design is near perfect. It is not totally leak proof but for the most part if you do find yourself tipping it you will get little to no drops.. That being said if you want to save some money going with a cheaper one would be fine.', 'What’s the point in creating a vacuum sealed mug if you make the lid out of thin plastic? The heat will still escape through the top.I am writing this based on initial impressions but since most people claim these don’t keep coffee hot beyond an hour or two, I expect to see the same and deduct stars after using it while camping and such. I hope I am proven wrong but I doubt it.', \"I used to really like Thermos for keeping my coffee super hot all day long. Now, I'm switching to Yeti brand. I absolutely love my tumbler because it keeps my coffee hot for hours, and unlike the thermos cups I've used, this one is super easy to clean.

Kinda disappointed with the cost of this it would leak.', 'I expected a tumbler that would hold 20 oz with the cover on  - not so - it is 20 oz to the brim, so technically that is correct but access to that amount of liquid with the cover on is not.  I was disappointed in this.', 'The newer design texture coated exterior is more appealing and very durable. I also like the magnetic closer on the lid. Simple pop it up to get a cleaner lid when washing it. I have a sticker applied to mine do I hand wash it every time. It is dishwasher safe.', 'I am glad I found this. I am a heavy tea drinker. After years of trying, finally I settled down with Kirkland green tea bags. This bottle works great for the way I drink tea.

The only complain is that it is not shaped well for holding. Kind of bulky.', 'So this thermos was such a disappointment. It wasn’t necessarily cheap either. I was expecting a YETI because it called itself a YETI. This thing doesn’t even keep liquid hot for three hours-Luke warm at best.. very dissatisfied on this purchase!

Unfortunately, the lid isn’t secure enough to keep the liquid from spitting or dribbling out when jiggled. I placed it in my “old lady” cart with my laptop and lunch box to go from my car to the office. There was coffee running down the side and pooled at the bottom. Great product if you don’t need to travel with it. However, I just put less coffee in it to try to compensate for the problem. Quite disappointed, since it cost so much.', 'Use every day for work, keep in lab. Put ice and electrolyte water. Stays ice cold entire day, even overnight. Fits perfectly in my cup holder.

Tip: if you are using it for coffee then close the slider on top when your not drinking. The coffee will cool a lot faster if you leave the slider open. I’ve purchased several Yeti products and I’ve yet to be disappointed. They put a lot of thought into the design of their products.', \"This tumbler is awesome.

His Yeti did come with the magslider lid which I'm thankful for since other customers were not as lucky with just getting a normal lid.\", 'Nice travel coffee mug but 2 pieces of the silicone sealing broke after rarely using it. The whole purpose of being sealed disappeared. I would have expected more from YETI…not a satisfied customer here for the price i paid for a travel mug.', \"Keeps drinks amazingly cold even overnight. I thought it was just an overpriced brand name product but a friend insisted it was worth it so I bought one and now I agree. I don's know what they do but if you want ice in your beverage all day long this is the way to go.\", \"I bought this for my hubby and he really likes it.  It's very sturdy, not too big but wide enough for his coffee.  Very easy to wash and great quality.  I highly recommend!\", 'Bought my first yeti years ago, maybe 5 or 6. Paid 50 bucks. At that time, seemed excessive. But it kept liquid piping hot for hours. Decided to replace my old yeti since it doesn’t keep my coffee hot any longer. Bought this one. Beautiful, foam green. Also 20 dollars less. But it is made in China, hence the cheaper price. I don’t believe it’s a fake yeti, they are just not made in Texas any longer. But quality is not the same either - this yeti doesn’t keep my coffee hot. At this point my old and very used one is doing a better job. So - overall, seems like a waste of money for subpar quality.', 'i love this cup! i have a few others and i really liked the pink color ! they keeps my drinkers super hot or super cold for forever and are just so cute and the perfect size! the pink color is beautiful and i just wish there was a prime option for this color!', 'Great size for traveling.

No matter how hot the car gets, i still have cold water on the drive home. Need I say more?', 'Very durable and easy to clean.

I would HIGHLY recommend getting the lid with the magnetic stopper, cuts back on sips big time! Fits in most cup holders and is easy to grip.', 'This is the best style coffee to go cup out there. The lid parts are easy to remove for cleaning which is the most important thing for me since I wash by hand. It keeps the coffee nice and warm and fits in all the cup holders. Love the color too!

After two hours the ice was still cooling my tea. I couldn't believe it. I gave the 20 ounce cup to my wife for her morning coffee. She now has to cool the coffee a bit before she leaves for work or it  stays to hot to drink! I have the 24 ounce cup on order now.\", 'I made some hot tea this morning before going to work and put it in my new Yeti tumbler. About 30 minutes later I arrived at work and went to take my first sip. The first thing that I noticed was that the outside of the tumbler was still very cold. Upon taking a sip however, the tea was still too hot to drink. I had to take the lid off to let it cool down a bit. It is now an hour later and the tea is still pleasantly hot. I will be ordering another one soon so I can keep one at home and one at the office!', 'Comments about Yeti tumblers have always been great, so I ordered two for my wife.  The tumbler itself is great. When Yeti describes the lids (magnetic closure) of their cups to be \"Leak Resistent\", they meant leak \"retardant\".  The lids do not resist leaks at all, they do slow the rate of flow down to about 1/4 of what it would be without the lid at all.  Laying a full 20oz tumbler down (with magnetic closing lid in closed position), I was able to fill a one cup measure in about 17 seconds (nearly one ounce per two seconds).  A rate that slow may work for some, but not for me, and certainly surprising for the price.', \"While this product isn't leak proof, I didn't buy this product looking for leak proof anyways. The magnetic slide hatch thing on top keeps liquids from splashing on a bumpy road, so it's good enough for me. The reason I bought this product was for it's simple design and easy to clean lid. I always hated tumblers with complicated lid parts that could never be washed properly, which would build gunk over time. You will not have that issue here. Both the O ring and the magnetic sliding hatch can be pulled off and cleaned, leaving a lid with no cleaning issues. The tumbler itself is just your standard coffee tumbler and retains heat like any other tumbler out there. Can't feel the heat on the outside, but liquids remain hot for hours. Lastly you get the bonus of the Yeti brand. Lol.\", 'Truely a wonder of modern technology. The insulating power of Yeti has yet to be matched by competitors. I was enchanted by the attention to detail provided by the product designers. It will keep anything warm, and I mean ANYTHING (if you know what I mean). I have no proof, but I believe that if Howie Mandel was on Shark Tank, and the inventors of Yeti were to pitch their ideas, he and Mark would go down on a 24/24 split shareholders deal. I can only imagine how the company would operate if it were run by Mark and Howie. Alas the wonderus worlds of the imagination alludes us.', \"My mother-in-law accidentally left this cup at our house on a recent visit, and I used it and became hooked. Had it not been for her, I don't think I would have ever paid $30 for a coffee cup! I knew I would have to eventually return hers next time we visited, so I bought one exactly like it for myself. It keeps my coffee hot/warm for hours--which is great, because I often don't drink it all in one sitting. So I am not wasting coffee by throwing out my cold drink after a few hours. The top fits very securely, and I like that the top is clear--I feel weird drinking out of a cup that I can't see into. It's also super easy to open/close the mouth opening. Highly recommend!\", 'Authentic Yeti! I was so worried after I purchased, I was worried it was going to be a lock off.

EnjoyG\", 'I am greatly disappointed in this tumbler as it holds at most 15 ounces if you want to use the lid, which is the only way to keep a beverage hot or cold. It barely hold 18 ounces without the lid without spilling over. I will no longer waste my money on Yeti products, especially since after contacting the company & telling them I did an actual measured pour in it & they still insist it holds 20 ounces but “you may not be able to use the lid with that much in it”. False advertising.', \"I do find these cups slightly overpriced but happy with the purchase of two of these. Adding a few ice cubes to your drink in the evening and by morning you will still have ice. I haven't tried hot drinks yet but I'm sure your coffee or tea will stay piping hot for many hours.\", \"This is definitely a great travel container. One helpful tip that everyone should know from the beginning is the fact that the magnetic slider on the lid is not permanently attached to the lid.  It is only secured by the magnet. I was unaware that my cup was accidentally bumped & the slider popped off. It's definitely a must have.\", \"my husband travels constantly  we have used numerous kinds of eye mask this by far is one of the best we ever tried and the affordable price makes it unbeatable  -  I just order another one for me - let's hope its long-lasting but so far it feels great, we received it in time and well packed, its very comfortable and affordable  - highly recommended\", 'Yeti is hands down the best mug!  I was impressed how long it kept my drink warm, but even more impressed with cold drinks.  I tested the mug on a hot day in July with ice cubes in the mug.

Ice lasts 8 hours overnight.  Couldn't be happier with the product.  Oh, and mine has not leaked from the lid as some others have experienced.\", 'I am disappointed in this Yeti.

I have had one for about a year that a friend bought me that I use at work and I decided I wanted a second one at home. Its great for keeping things cold.

Yeti products are truly one of the best. Keeps things hot and fits perfectly in your cup holder.', 'Any believe it took me so long to get one. I usually use disposable drinking cups because of pain to clean and no benefit to a reusable. That was dumb. This is super easy to clean, no coffee or tea rings.

This came, exactly as expected and described, witha sliding magnetic lid. I registered it with Yeti and I'll be getting Yeti stickers in the mail, just like with every other Yeti product. Bottom line is, this wasn't a knockoff.\", \"For the price I was expecting hot coffee to be hotter longer.  But this mug doesn't keep coffee hot as well as my previous insulated coffee mug.  The trade off, I guess, is that this one is dishwasher safe.  It's not particularly leak proof either, unfortunately.  If I knew then what I know now, I would a purchased something different.\", \"I like everything about the Yeti, takes a long time for ice to melt so drink doesn't get watered down quickly.Easy to clean, it's the real deal.

Too expensive too for something that doesn’t work!', 'In order for my water to keep cold, I must add ice.

I can pour a hot cup of coffee and find it still quite warm many hours after.  For cold drinks, I once left some ice and water in the tumbler overnight and by mid morning next day, the ice was still there! Really impressed!

Otherwise, it's definitely worth the money and I intend to buy a few more.\", 'it came without the magnetic slider and when I called to just get the missing part, they sent a whole new cop that had to be returned within a short window.... it made work for us.

I find it tends to keep tea nice and hot for the first 4 hours and then tapers off to luke warm after 6 hours. I was hoping it would stay super hot for 8+ hours, this has not been my experience. I spent the extra money on this tumbler hoping it would keep my drink hotter than less expensive items. This was not the case. The seal for the cover is super solid, however there is some leakage through the magnetic sip cover. Overall I’m happy but, I was expecting more.', 'It did not come with the magnetic cover for the lid. Others have commented on this as well. It was very disappointing.****Update *****They made it right and sent me a new lid following week which we got rather quickly.', 'This product is amazing. It keeps hot liquids hot, and cold liquids cold. I’ve never seen a cup that can do both as well as this cup/yeti products.  I had a cold drink with ice in my 20 oz Yeti Cup w sliding magnetic click top. It was a day where the outside temperature was 102. And I live in Virginia, so with the humidity, it was more like 115. And I left my Yeti Cup in the car cup holder. It was only about half full. When I got back to the car 4 hours later, and mind you, my car was in full sun, so it had to be over 150 degrees  in the car.

I would fill it with hot water from our Insta-Hot and let it warm up the cup before pouring my coffee.  This worked, but if I wanted hot coffee for more than 15 - 20 minutes, I was out of luck.  This Yeti Rambler totally exceeded my expectations for keeping coffee hot:  1.5 hours after pouring my drink, the coffee was still nice and hot.  IMHO - you get what you pay for and I'very pleased with my investment in this Yeti product.\", 'Love the clean white color. Love how it fits right in my cup holder in my car! As a teacher, it sometimes takes a while to drink my coffee and it DOESN’T keep my coffee hot all day. I pour it at 7am and if my coffee isn’t gone by 9am it’s cold. That’s a little disappointing to me. The magnaslide is nice but definitely is not leakproof. Contigno is nice because it keeps it hot longer and the lid is leakproof. Honestly, I bought the YETI because I heard such nice reviews but it did not live up to its expectation. I will try it with a cold liquid and see how long it stays cold.', 'Nothing really to dislike about this product. Keeps either cold or hot beverages at a constant temperature for quite a long performance of time. I was very happy with the purchace!', 'This should be recategorized.

We need tumblers we can take adventuring with us and this one just isn’t it. I will say it keeps hot stuff hot very well. But even just driving in the car with it in the cup holder, it spills out through the lid. It’s a pretty poor seal. If I’m holding it and walking, it spills out. Wondering if I just got a faulty lid?? Either way. Certainly not worth the money. Our Walmart tumblers hold contents better. Really wanted to like but overall just disappointed. Want to trust that the contents won’t be spilling everywhere while we are camping, boating, hunting etc.', 'I use this cup daily. It’s keeps my drink cold until the last drop. That could be several hours.

Also this cup did not have the yeti authorized sticker on the bottom. Our other 2 came with a sticker not sure why. It was packaged poorly, not enough around the cup to cushion it. But this dent looks like it is a factory defect.', \"The first thing I did was (accidentally) drop it down the concrete steps at my front door.  No dents, dings; the lid flew off and the sliding piece came off. It's magnetic! Just popped it back on.  Knocking it over on my desk a few drops might drip out but at least it isn't everything.

I love it - it keeps my water, iced coffee, etc. cold for as long as I need! I often fill it up with ice water at night and have ice still in it when I wake up in the morning. It isn't leak proof (mostly because the cover isn't meant to be). If you're look for a leak-proof option, I use Contigo for coffee/hot drinks in the winter and that works great. The only downside is that the slider top is magnetic, so I've lost them when they pop off and I don't realize it. But, I mostly have a straw in my rambler, so I don't miss the slider much. If you use/need to use the slider, then you may not like that they come off pretty easily. I do hand wash my ramblers during the week and put them in the dishwasher about once per week. I've been doing this for well over a year and haven't had any problems. These are great, and worth the money.\", 'I love anything YETI because of the quality and this Rambler did not let me know.

I like it but I don't see why they get hyped I usually fill it about 3/4 full of coffee at around 5 in the morning but by 9-10 it's already Luke warm, but I'm not sure if they claim to hold heat at longer time then that.

Needed it for my night shift to keep my coffee warm and it did the trick! The aqua blue is beautiful! Keeps it hot for about 3-4 hours.

Would def buy more.', 'This travel mug is great, I knew that I could trust the Yeti brand. It keeps my drinks hot for over 2 hours and the outside of the mug does not get warm at all, so you can carry it any time. I will say that I even have to wait to drink anything hot in it, when the lid is on, to be sure not to burn myself. If you do not keep the lid on, though, it will cool faster.

It keeps it warm for 3 hours but it’s not very hot after only half an hour.  To be fair, I have not tried “preheating” my mug before pouring my coffee in.

The color is gorgeous.', 'When Yeti says “ the only drink lid that uses the power of magnets to keep your water, beer, or favorite drink on lock”, I took that term ‘lock’ to mean it wouldn’t leak.

Item is sweat proof, so no need to worry about ruining wood furniture ...', 'The yeti is the best travel mug, ever. I purchased the 20 ounce and purchased the handle that goes with it. It was a gift to my husband and he loves it! He had it at work and the part that slides to take a drink and then shut it, fell off and he thought he broke it, only to find out it is a magnet! Brilliant idea....so easy to clean, I have not seen a travel mug with that feature. The Yeti is by far the best travel mug, and I highly recommend the handle.', \"I have owned many knock off 20oz tumblers that fail to keep there vacuum properties after a few months.So far this one lives up to it's name and I believe it will continue to do so.  If not I will use the five year guarantee!It has already proven to be a great product, in that there is no loss of temperature from the first sip to the last.\", \"Bought the prickly pear color.. absolutely love it.  it keeps my tea hot for hours and my ice doesn't melt when I have a cold drink. Cant wait to travel to Aruba and take it along for the ride.\", 'I bought this rambler to gift husband so that he could enjoy warm coffee during the winter. But the lid was missing the slider. With this missing item, it is impossible to keep the drinks warm. What a disappointment 😩😩😩', 'Awesome! The fact that it’s dishwasher safe makes it top-dog in my book. Hand washing all our other travel mugs gets old quick when you have kids and are forever in a hurry. The magnetic lid slider is also the reason for this high review. All other travel mugs have those built in sliders that collect gunk and over time are so revolting you want to throw it away, but this magnetic slide allows you to pick it off and wash it separately so every nook gets nice and clean. I got this for my husband and he LOVES it :) The grip is also very nice.', 'We bought these Yeti’s to use on a recent cruise. I also use it as a water cup at work now. It keeps drinks cold, and it’s easy to drink out of the magnetic slider top. I like that it’s dishwasher safe as well. It’s hefty though (especially when filled up), so stick with Tervis if you prefer a lighter drinking cup. The Yeti is expensive but it should last for a very long time.', 'We use these tumblers up to several times a day. They are very durable and don\\'t fall apart in the dishwasher like some other \"dishwasher safe\" tumblers we have had.', \"I ordered two of these and one arrived without the mag-slider lid part. Contacted customer service and they quickly shipped a replacement out. Cups work like a charm. I've tried a few different ones now and the design of these is best in class.\", \"I'm a little surprised by the design of the mug. For starters, I can't get my hand all the way to the bottom of the mug to clean it. Mostly, it's the thermal design that puzzles me. If you look at the top of the mug, you'll see a metal rim. The metal rim is the same metal that's on the inside of the mug. The metal rim acts as a heat conductor, allowing the heat from the hot liquid to be transferred to the outside of the mug. The mug doesn't keep your coffee hot for as long as it could if the metal rim wasn't there. I bought the mug based on the company’s reputation for making coolers. I’m a little disappointed, there are better mugs out there if you want to keep your coffee hot.\", 'This is the real deal. I left a cold drink in the hot car for over an hr. It was not only cold but the ice was still in there :)', 'I was looking in for a tumbler that keeps things hot and cold for a long time that is was dishwasher safe.  I looked at a number of tumblers and decide on this 20oz Yeti Rambler. I have been using it and am very happy with it.  I have added a handle and two othertops, straws and a handle.  It is a little on the heavy side but worth it because of its other positive features.', 'I bought this expensive tumbler for my husband for Christmas. He used it his first day back to work and coffee spilt all over the front of him. He had to stay that way all day. I felt really bad. I returned the tumbler.', 'Love the color! My car cup holders are in an awkward place and this fits perfect in my car cup holder (2019 BMW 530i) since it’s shorter than my other YETI. My drinks stay cold and I have ice after 24 hours but for hot drinks, this didn’t keep my coffee warm for more than a few hours.', 'This Yeti tumbler was everything I was searching for: a larger capacity container that would work with my Keurig coffee maker; phenomenal in keeping liquids hot for an extended period of time; dishwasher safe; and looks stylish, too!', 'Yeti is great for hot coffee and what not but they’re at their best when you put cold drinks and ice in them. Ice will stay cold in here for hours. Yetis are so worth the money.', 'I was so delighted by all the reviews, because I need a cup with a tight seal to put in my backpack and take to work.  First time out: I poured a cup of hot tea into the Yeti and put it in my backpack with a smile.  About 20 minutes later looked in the backpack to find the lid still fixed on top but tea spilled everywhere, damaging my books.  (Note: the cup was also kept upright throughout.)I can only conclude that the seal on the Yeti is very poor.  I cannot recommend this product to anyone.', 'I never knew I needed this, but wow, it keeps things cold for a long time.I love cold water... if I make iced water before bed, it will still be cold when I wake up in the morning.I will never use a regular water bottle/glass again.', 'This is a great size for 90% of drinks, whatever you may be drinking at the time. 20oz. seems a lot easier to handle too vs. the larger Yeti tumblers we have.And this one keeps ice as long as the other larger Yeti’s. I use mine almost daily during the hotter months.', 'Wowww, fantastic product eh! From the thickness to the color. Except, you must be careful; It keeps your tea/coffee so hot, you can burn yourself easily. I usually placed two/three ice cubes before sipping my drink.', 'The MagSlider has only \"OPEN\" or \"SHUT\" positions. It will not give you control over how much the slider opens. You have to adjust your coffee drinking preferences to that of the Mug! The slider is unable to adjust to your preferences.It only opens or shuts. In addition to this, the mug is also heavy, big and not easy to hold.The mug is very high quality solidly built. I just wish they give these two concerns a thought.', 'This is my third Yeti. I love the color and the lid that keeps my drink hot for long. The lids of my different mugs can be Interchangeable, so I use this lid on my smaller mug more often.', 'i love it! its leakproof, easy to clean (the magnetic lid comes off and can be washed separately!), holds temp pretty well. when i put ice full cup with lids closed all day the ice will still be there (some melted) till next morning. hot morning coffee will stay warm till afternoon if the lid is closed.', \"I've been using this Yeti tumbler now for three months and I can say it is all they claim it to be. My coffee stays hot for three hours! I can only say three hours because after that my coffee is finished. I highly recommend this tumbler and the handle that fits for more comfort for smaller hands.\", 'We always carry  tumblers in our cars.  This is the best one ever.  The design concept is unique as far as we know. Very simply a pleasure to use.', 'Is all brand. It is not leak proof, if it is tilt it will leak, so an accidental knock will make a mess. It is somewhat easy to hold and clean. It has got a magnet slide for the fluid to flow so you just have to keep in mind to remove it in order to clean that area (easy to misplace).', \"I bought this and it works great.  It will keep ice solid for a day!  Since I bought this one, I've bought about 6 more in different sizes.\", \"The clear lid it came with leaks if it falls over, and it doesn't keep things very warm for very long. Was so excited to have a Yeti and it's not as nice as I heard it would be 😞\", 'Love!!! I have ozark timber and finally broke down buying this. It definitely keeps your liquid hot or cold longer than ozark. This is how I measure, with my ozark cup, my coffee stays warm the ride to work and about an hour after I get there. With the yeti, my coffee stays warm till almost lunch time!', 'Love Yeti products. These work great for hot and cold and are very sturdy. I have had mine for three years and no issues. Just got this one for my husband and he loves it. This has kept my ice overnight. Keeps hot drinks hot for hours! I highly recommend this product.', \"I love this tumbler so much. It holds the perfect amount of coffee and keeps it warm for the entire time I'm drinking it. Yeti is a great brand and I'm so happy I found it on Amazon!\", 'Although more expensive than some tumblers, it is well worth the money.  I have only used it for cold beverages so far. It keeps cold throughout the day, including being left in a hot car.', 'I always thought this brand was overpriced, but you get what you pay for.  Even in cold winter weather, my coffee is hot/warm throughout the entire day!!  Love it and gifting every coffee drinker I know with one for Christmas.', 'Love everything about this tumbler. Only \"complaint\" is that my coffee stays so hot during my car commute that I cannot finish it in time to avoid bringing it on the train.', 'A product that does all you could ask of it. Keeps cold cold for 6 hours and more. Just as proficient at keeping hot beverages hot. Excellent quality. Little pricey but well worth it', 'I have owned many types of similar products so I did not believe the ads that this was any different. They all lose their heat/cold very quickly. Not till I heard from frirrnds how good the Yeti is. So I bought one for my wife. If she likes it then it’s good. She loved it so I got one for my self and now we are a Yeti couple!  Don’t know how it is insulated but it works. A great product!', 'I waited so long to buy a yeti cup because in my mind the price of this cup is unreasonable. After using this cup every single day all day long for a week my mind is changed! My drinks stayed cold (haven’t tested for heat) for well over 12 hours. Its truly one of my best buys!', \"Its exactly what I've been hearing and expected! My kids dropped it off the end table and the lid held tight. People who complain about melting ice, hv u considered how much ice ur andding and how hot the day is? Maybe u need to look into the real issues, and not say it's a bad cup ( there all the same). LOVE IT! Making the switch out from my nervous tumblers over time.\", 'Was disappointed with the Yeti. Was great at keeping things cold but does not keep things hot which is what I mainly purchased it for. It is also hard to hold as it has a wide diameter. I should have read through description more carefully. If you won’t be carrying it in your hand and will use to keep beverages cold, great purchase.', 'I bought this as a gift. My husband loves it.  Keeps coffee hot for hours. I like that you can take the slide and rubber gasket off to clean,since we don’t  have a dishwasher.', 'This cup does not hold 20 ounces of liquid. I drink the 16.9 size water bottles and it does not fit in this cup.', 'High quality insulation.  Tumbler keeps liquid cold or hot and fits in the car cup holder.  The lid is easy to drink from and easy to take off and put on. I plan to purchase more Yeti drinkers.', 'The Magslider Lid on the Yeti is a nice feature except I already lost the Magslider after only two days of use. Getting a replacement Magslider when they are out of stock is a big issue. Apparently I am not the only one that lost the Magslider. YETI makes great products and this feature is very convenient but also has a downside. The Magslider lid also prevents the tumbler from being leak proof. YETI should sell these products with an option to purchase with either the Magslider or Leak Proof lids or include both with the purchase.', 'I bought this as a gift for my son.....really happy to buy a Yeti....when he opened it....the magnet closer is missing!!  Still usable...but...I expected it to be all intact. Kind of disappointed!', 'I love this size because it isn’t too heavy and fits great in my cup holder. Pretty and keeps ice in my drink even when left in a parking lot for several hours. I like the larger size too for drinking water all day at my desk, ice cold.', 'Yeti quality is always the only thing I have against it was having to pay twice as much for the color but supply and demand', 'Bought this Yeti for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. We both have the larger cups but he wanted something smaller for his coffee that would also fit in his car cup holder. This is working perfectly. The color is really nice too. Would recommend this and all Yeti products.', \"Loving this yeti rambler so far! It's an ideal size for my morning coffee and tea. I didn't realize it at first but the black piece that slides on the lid is magnetic. I dropped the lid on the floor and the piece popped off. I thought it was broken but was able to put it back on easily.\", 'Did not like due to fact it dies not perform like other YETI cups. Did not keep beverage cold for over 3 hrs. Was this made in China?', \"This was a gift for Christmas and just got around to using it two days ago. It did not keep my coffee cold. I gave it another chance yesterday and again did not keep my coffee cold. I am unsure if this is a defective product because I have other Yeti's (stainless steel ones) and they are fine. I can only give this a 2 star review. I missed the window by 3 days to return it . If you have a choice do not buy this black cup.\", 'Great cup. Works well. Love the mag slider lid.  Makes it super easy to keep clean.  No icky coffee funk collecting underneath.  Just a super solid product.  Only things that could improve: size - I have larger than average hands, but I dont feel my grip on the mug is 100% secure; lid not 100% leak proof - but this is fine for a coffee mug.  If I need leak proof I will get a thermos.', 'The most challenging part of this tumbler is how heavy it is. I can only put my 16.9oz bottled water in the 20oz. I’ve only used it for cold, but it does a great job. Love the tight magnetic closure and color. I don’t like that more “popular” colors cost more.', \"If you love your coffee hot like i do, you need one of these. I loved it so much, i got my friends some too. They come in every color, are well made, and the magnet lid is ingenious. No spills. Just don't sign up for the ''free gift'' with registration. They will send you 3 stickers with their logo that you'll never use, and your spam folder will increase tenfold.\", 'PRO: keeps my hot beverage hot for a long time.CON: the lid IS NOT securely fastened. It will leak, and the top will fall off if the Yeti tips over. That could mean hot coffee everywhere including your lap.', 'I love hot coco in the morning but nothing was keeping it hot on my commute to work. This thing works great for that! My parents got this for me as a birthday present and I have used it everyday since. A bit hard to clean the top but nothing too bad. It keeps it hot for almost an entire day and doesn’t spill.', 'I like them. They work well, fit snugly in cup holders, aren’t in the way while driving, and keep drinks cool. This one is a replacement for the one some rat stole from my lawn chair at a car show, may he develop an unsightly skin condition.', 'Yeti is the best, I bought this 20 oz. as a gift for my daughter and she like me uses it everyday. I have the 32 oz. which was a gift to me. The 32 oz is a little cumbersome for me, but I make it work. I fill it about 1/4 of the way full with ice and the rest with cold water out of fridge and at the end of the day there is still ice in it. Take it out when working in the yard for hours and it stays cold with leftover ice.', 'CHINA not USA... I have been looking for a thermal cup for some time now.  Looking at all the information provided by the maker, I was under the impression that this product was made in the USA.  Unfortunately, after unpacking and reading the bottom of the tumbler,  it states designed in Texas, MADE IN CHINA!I would not have made the purchase if I known that it was made in CHINA.', 'Works very well at keeping coffee hot.  When I clean it, I remove the magnet to allow the lid to completely dry.  Otherwise, moisture will remain.', \"best tumbler so far, keeps coffee hot, it is a large tumbler and won't fit in some cars due to it circumference size\", 'I LOVE YETI! This color is so cute, and it still looks sleek and outdoorsy! The kid isn’t entirely leak proof but it’s ok with me. It is harder to hold than the water bottle yetis, but that’s expected. I filled it up with icecream at the cafeteria today and there wasn’t a drop of meaty icecream in the cup when I got back to my dorm 20 minutes later! It’s perfect for hot and cold drinks and it’s so easy to clean! It’s nice to not worry about a straw also, so this mug is great for the liquids other than water.

Pretty disappointing.\", 'I was gifted a large Yeti a few years ago but I was looking for something a little smaller. I absolutely love this. I use it every day.', 'Pretty much leak proof, not 100% yet by far better than most. If slider in closed position, and cup falls over - no immediate spill. Some drops might get past slider if on side longer than a few seconds. Magnet slider is great as gives better seal than a rubber gasket and no annoying whistling that some gaskets give when steam is escaping.Very practical cup, keeps coffee/tea warm for hours, maybe not quite as long as some other brands. I like this cup way more. Feels right. Got one for everyone in house, they feel the same. Yeti products are solid.', 'The best coffee cup I’ve ever owned. I’m always getting compliments on the clean white color and have had a few order their own white one after seeing the look of mine in person. The white doesn’t stain at all. One day I left my coffee in my car for 2 hours while the air temperature was 10 (Fahrenheit) and I came back to still hot coffee.', \"With the magnetic slider for the mouth piece doesn't fully stop the flow if you drop the cup, it DOES make for easy cleaning!

(Seriously I put my coffee cup down and forgot where I put it, found it 3 hours later and it was still hot! ) I love this cup, 10/10 would buy again\", \"It was a gift for my father for father's day, gave it to him early because I felt he needed it. He's said only good of it, how he would typically have to reheat his drink at least three times in the amount of time the mug kept it hot. As they say as hot or cold as science will allow! Truth!\", 'I love the Yeti tumbers. Great insulating properties and one of the few Yeti products that are affordable. I have several of these and love them.', \"It's a bit large for my hands. Get a handle!  It may leak if tipped over but the removable slide is so easy to really clean. And the coffee stays HOT until the last swig.  It IS worth the price if you like your hot drinks hot.\", 'I adore Yeti products! I have several different tumblers. I ordered 5 from two different shippers and this one came without a magslider. I was giving them as gifts the following day so I washed one I already had to give with this tumbler. I just don\\'t understand how quality checkers miss that! You cannot keep your drinks hot or cold if the lid cannot close. Normally I would give the \"leak proof\" section a 5/5 but gave it a 1/5 due to this mistake.', 'Its not leak proof. Walking to my car to the front of the building i work in, takes no more than 10 steps and even in that small distance my coffee spills over the magnetic piece. Not a huge spill, but it’s annoying.

I use this for hot coffee, cold smoothies, iced water and anything else. Anything you put in this cup keeps temperature for hours.

Best travel mugs on the market! You won’t be disappointed', \"Unlike all the immitation tumblers this one actually has an opening that liquid flows freely from. The top is what makes it worth buying. The base is the same even for $12 immitations. It's the top that make it worth paying extra for the Yeti.\", \"I use this for my coffee!  The lid is nice and tight and the coffee does not drip.  The magnet on the mouthpiece is the best opening I've seen in a travel cup thus far.\", 'One of the features I liked was that this was supposedly dishwasher safe.

I must say I am absolutely pleased with this feature. However, I am very disappointed at how the lid leaks. I placed my thermos in my lunch bag for easy transport. I arrived to work to find coffee spilt all inside my lunch bag from the coffee leaking from the lid. I thought it might have been because I overfilled it. However, the next day I filled it less and put it in my cupholder in my car. Coffee still leaked all on top of the lid during my drive. Not sure if my thermos was defected but very challenging to use as it constantly leaks.', 'I put my morning coffee in this when I’m working. Keeps it hot! Would definitely buy again.', \"I love my yeti and it keeps things very cold and very hot. The main problem is that every time i drop it, the lid pops off and the drink goes everywhere. Thank goodness it's usually water but it always gets on my nerves. It doesn't dent but if you get this I would try not to drop it. Also when i barely have water left in my yeti it makes a weird noise like something is dripping? But it's not. When i open the lid though, the water splashes everywhere and I don't understand why it does this.\", \"It's only been about 2 months, and I can't figure out why, but water is leaking from between the cup and the lid..

My fault for leaving it out. It keeps my coffee hot for hours and ice water cold for hours. People say but they are expensive.

If you look at the inside the stainless steel is different, the weight is different as well. Doesn't keep drinks cold nor hold, melts the ice right away, might as well buy a regular cheap cup. This one feels very light, its not sturdy at all. I returned and got my money back.\", \"I've already used it so I can't send it back, but a $10mug from the dollar store would hold ice longer. Ice starts melting within an hour, and coffee starts getting Luke warm within an hour.

Then I used one if the travel mugs and became a believer. Absolutely worth the money and blown away with how well they are made. Keeps beverages HOT or COLD ten times longer than any other insulated mug I have ever used. I cannot recommend the YETI mugs enough!!!!!!', \"My favorite to go cup. I researched for alternatives to Yeti because of the price. But their quality beats out the other brands. Dishwasher safe, fits my cup holder, does what it's supposed to. Doesn't chip like others I've tried. Only suggestion is to get or make sure you get the magnetic closing lid. Then it's perfect.\", \"I love this beverage holder better than any I have had.

Of course, the longer you have the lid open/the more you open it, the coffee cools a bit.  But I love the look and don’t have any complaints.  So far I am happy with the purchase.I will say, I am a new coffee drinker and do not have experience with similar products to compare it to.', 'I like that it was exactly what I expected!  I had family that told me it was just what I needed.  They were right!!!', \"As long as you go into this purchase knowing that it will leak if full and not kept upright, and the focus of the lid design was more geared towards practicality and ease of cleaning, then you should be very satisfied. It's a great design and stays hot/cold for as long as one should reasonably expect. I love the contigo products for stashing coffee in a backpack or throwing into an inner coat pocket, but there are nooks in the underside of the lids that are difficult to clean and get very disgusting. This product was worth it to me for the cleaning alone.\", 'Some what easy to hold. Its not leak proof but keeps liquids warm for longer duration than other coffee mugs. It has a hard clear plastic top with a magnetic sliding lid.', 'Works great for hot and cold beverages, and keeps them that way for hours! Incredibly durable, all the pieces are dishwasher safe, and the colors are great too. Highly recommended!', \"Will keep your drink cold all day! Haven't tried hot drinks in it, but I'm sure it's insulated enough to do the same!\", 'Very handy to keep water cold on my nightstand overnight and refill during the day so the fridge is not being opened so often.', \"The lid spills all the way. It is not easy to hold for a woman because it's too wide.I left coffee in it and 2 hours later it was cold. I guess you need to buy their special lid, which I was expecting to be part of the cup.\", \"This is misleading. When I order a 20 oz product it is because I want to drink 20 oz. It's impossible to fit 20 oz in this with the lid. This should be labeled 16 oz or 18 oz. Very disappointed.\", 'The complaint I have is how they did not give specific instructions on how to clean the inside as regular sponge scratches the inside easily. Also, the yeti  turned yellow on the inside after a week.', 'I was quite excited to get a YETI for Christmas, as you hear such great things. The containment of heat and cold liquid without condensation on the outside of the tumbler DOES absolutely live up to its name in high standard and would get a 5-star rating on that element. But, overall with the very pool lid design, it gets a 2. Considering how much you pay for a YETI, it is VERY reasonable to expect a lid that does not leak. The magnet snap shut valve at the top that they rave about is the issue. I cannot put it in my backpack or in another bag full, as it will leak all over when walking. To have to have a free hand to carry your tumbler wherever you go is VERY inconvenient. The old-style black Starbucks lid/stainless steel tumbler is still best in my book.', 'The cup is sturdy and the red color is excellent. Best of all is the ability of the cup to keep whatever liquid is in it the same temperature; either hot or cold. It is perfect for the cup holder in my Rodeo!', 'I own a few of these mugs and I love them. They keep my coffee hot for hours and they fit in my standard cup holders in my car. Stars off as my tumbler arrived with the magnetic lid, but it is clearly missing the sliding magnet deeming the lid pretty useless (others have stated the same regarding their purchase.) Buyer beware.', \"I got one of these from my company for Christmas, and it kept my drink warm FOREVER.  Also the removable magnetic cover makes it so easy to clean the spots on the lid that usually get nasty.

Keeps drinks hot or cold for hours with no sweating on the cup so it’s easy to hold. Best one around! I can’t imagine a better designed tumbler. Very easy to clean as it is dishwasher safe and great colors to choose from.  Everyone should have one :)', 'The cup is not actually leak proof if you tip it over and pick it up quickly you might be able to get it before it leaks the cop does not retain its heat coffee gets cold quick definitely not happy with the price for the type of product it is', 'I love this thing. More expensive, yes, but it seals up great, the multiple tops are very useful, the plastic straw is sturdy and it keeps the water cool for hours.', 'This really is a great mug. It feels great in the hand, and keeps my coffee nice and hot. It is also dishwasher safe and FITS IN MY KEURIG (very important)!The only thing missing is a truly leak proof (spill proof) lid. The mag slider lid is not spill proof or leak proof. I think even using the word \"resistant\" is a bit of a stretch. Before use with coffee I decided to test the lid by placing water in the mug. If you turn it upside down over the sink, water pours out of the spout. I think if Yeti can design a truly spill proof / leak proof lid, they will have achieved perfection.', 'Keeps my coffee hot to warm for hours!Nice looking.

Coffee stays warm for long periods of time even in cold conditions.', \"I accidentally left my gifted Yeti at work and it walked away! 😳 So I had to replace it! It's my favorite travel mug by far!\", 'I have a Hydroflask that I purchased a couple of years ago for my car, and was disappointed that it does not keep my water cold for very long.

Otherwise it would’ve been 5 stars across the board.', 'This is my second Yeti tumbler, I love my first one so much I wanted a second in another color. These are super high quality.

It may be a little pricey but you won't have to buy another coffee tumbler again (unless it is a gift for someone else)…...well worth the extra money.\", \"This cup doesn't keep drinks warm for as long as you'd expect when you are outdoors(at temps below 60 degrees fahrenheit) which was 50% of the reason I bought this product.  The slide mechanism on the lid allows liquid to leak out. It will leak out mostly when the cup is 95% full on any road that isn't smooth as glass. However it will leak out at any level over 60% if roads are rough, curvy, or if you have to stop suddenly. There are cheaper cups available that preform just as well as the YETI cup or better. I'd say 1/4 of the price of this cup is just for the YETI logo painted on the side(which does turn some heads from curious potential customers looking for info or an upgrade).  This cup does look nice and has a nice weight to it but isn't worth the $30 price tag.\", 'YETI always makes a good product, 3 stars due to color that was powered was green, and well I received a red one.', 'Love that it keeps coffee hot for long time not to keen on the lid design its a bit wide and to much chance of spilling.

I’m keeping it though because I like it and the dent is not noticeable unless you are really looking at it.', 'Yes, they are expensive! However, I think they are worth it. Living in FL our cars get extremely hot inside, especially in the summer.

Many tumblers when used will leak a little when you turn it up to take a drink. This one does not. To me that is an important feature.

I’m confident that this will last me a while.One con I can see is that this needs to be held upright.

I ordered the seafoam color and it is super cute. I haven't had any chipping issues yet again, I've only had it fro about a month.It keeps the my coffee hot.

I love the light blue color and the variety of other colors that are offered. The 20 oz is the perfect size for my morning coffees on the go.

About 1/6 of melted ice. Conclusion: nothing but name (brand). If I were you, I'd choose Rtic.\", 'It being of the acclaimed “yeti” brand, this tumbler was terrible. Sure aestetics, the feel are nice, it’s yeti, but what it is actually suppose to do like keep the drink inside of the tumbler, was not happening. I bought this for my wife who uses public transportation to commute to work. She needed something reliable, durable. What good is the product of it cannot even stay inside of the tumbler ?

This cup isn’t leak proof, and I got my husband the screw top version because of that. If full and tilted even slightly the drink comes through the lid. Besides that though, I love the Yeti brand and their mugs are awesome.', \"The Rambler did not meet my expectations. It does not keep my coffee warm for very long and it is not spill proof. It leaked into my bag so I wouldn't recommend it for travel. I use it now primary to drink my shooties since I don't have to worry about it getting cold fast. Save your money and buy a Contigo coffee mug for about half the price.\", 'At more than double the price of most Insulated Tumblers this just simple does not hold ice as long as expected and is a little large for my hands, yes mine are kind of small but still??? Simply just to expensive for what you get, I think I will send it back!!!', \"This does a great job keeping coffee hot. It fits in a cupholder and is easy to hold, but it's not leak proof.

I use it in the house to make sure I am drinking plenty of fluids.  Love the aquamarine color.\", 'Easier to clean than most water bottles. Keeps your drink cold all day or all night.', \"The lid is really disappointing. For a product billed as a durable outdoor item at this price point, the lid should be able to be screwed on and the mouthpiece adequately sealed. The lid relies on a rubber seal to stay on and there is a plastic slide for the mouthpiece that will leak going over the slightest bump in the road even when closed. I've had prior travel mugs that were priced more reasonably that included features to keep the liquid sealed. The mugs could be tossed in a bag with complete confidence everything wouldn't be covered in coffee when the bag was reopened. This mug misses the mark.\", 'Loved the magnetic top which is a slide open/closure.  Keeps ice for 24 hours!  Great product!!!😊', 'Works as well as other cheaper products  that I’ve bought before.

I refuse to recommend this brand.', \"I love this tumbler!!  It's just the right size and not too heavy to carry around.  It's also subtle so I can use it when I'm facing the congregation.  The tumbler itself is too big for my hand but with the added handle it works just great.\", 'G ave it to it GF and she says she loves it…I suspect she wouldn’t  lie😘.', 'YETI is great as we all know, and this travel mug is perfect for the static individual looking to enjoy a cup of warm coffee even hours after it has been poured. But for anyone planning to travel at all with this mug, I really wouldn’t recommend it. I bought this mug to take to class with me, but if I even tip it a little bit to the side, which is an unavoidable event when carrying it, it leaks like crazy. The lid is a piece of crap. I am really disappointed because I have other, much less expensive travel mugs that I can hold upside down without worrying about leakage. This one I can barely even tilt without having that worry. YETI really should do a better job making higher quality lids for these mugs.', 'My company sent out the largest Yeti cups to everyone with our logo on them.

I have seen post that stated it is fake. That’s not true. I have others and they look the same. It has a great seal; hence no leaks! Keeps my coffee hot, and doesn’t leak. What more can you ask for? Buy it and be happy!', \"I have only used this for three days but so far it hasn't leaked, although I have not turned it upside down, but why would you do that anyway? It keeps hot coffee hot, cold things cold. I find it easy to drink from while on the go. I do find it difficult to hold with my arthritic hands. I would do better with a handle, which is my reason for giving the tumbler 4 stars.\", \"Total garbage and not worth the money unless you can keep the lid completely parallel to the ground. I made my coffee, put it in my bag, walk for blocks and by the time i got on the bus I could smell my coffee.  Not necessarily the results that Yenti pitches or justifies a $30 price tag. I am so glad I chose to put it in a plastic bag lined with paper towels before putting it in my bag or everything would have been covered in coffee. The top where you drink from was leaking like crazy. What a joke this thing is. Trust me, buy an Otterbox. At least they don't leak.\", \"$30 for a travel mug that won't keep the contents inside is ridiculous.  The MagSlider doesn't totally seal when closed, so if the cup is tilted, the contents dribble out.  Returning for a refund.

If you have any liquid in the cup and turn it over it drips for a minute. It does stop after a little bit of liquid though', 'I should have read more of the description and reviews before I paid $30 for a cup. For such a nice, well insulated mug, the lid is crap.

The sliding action is fantastic, but it\\'s barely \"splash\" proof, let alone leak proof.

I bought the Yeti Rambler 20 oz. to take with me when I am driving because the larger Yeti tumbler is a bit of a chore to get out of the cup holder and to grip with one hand while trying to steer with the other hand. The Rambler did just what I needed. It is easier to get out of the cup holder, easier to grip (both because of its size and its felt-like surface), and much lighter than the larger tumbler. Unfortunately, it doesn't even come close to keeping beverages as cold of for as long as my old, larger tumbler. And after all, keeping beverages cold for long periods of times is precisely the reason we buy the expensive Yeti products.

My husband often uses this rambler for cold beverages and the ice lasts for hours. I'd say my coffee stays good and HOT for about an hour, but I also like my coffee hotter than the average person, so consider me biased. We were given an Ozark Trail rambler for Christmas last year that I've used daily. Honestly, there isn't much difference between the Ozark Trail and YETI ramblers, except $10. The YETI is also heavier than the Ozark Trail. The one thing that's nice on the YETI is the sliding cap on the lid that locks into place and keeps beverages from splashing out. This is an upgrade that I don't believe is available on the Ozark Trail rambler; however, I wouldn't say it's worth $10, especially since Ozark Trail now offers many colors like the YETI ramblers. As far as I know, Ozark Trail also does not offer a 5 year warranty like YETI does, which I also didn't realize was an option until I pulled the registration card from my rambler (note: the warranty is only good if you register the product). I was also given a very pretty rich red YETI rambler for Christmas, as well as a mint green one. I'd say we're good and set for YETI ramblers for awhile. Overall it's a very nice product but I wouldn't go out and buy one for myself. They are, however, very nice gifts since they're good at what they do, and the name recognition makes it looks like you spent a lot (which you sorta did...but look for a sale!).\", 'Black tab leaks when shut.

We ran errands, leaving our drinks in the summer hot car between locations.  When we returned home, both tumblers were about half full, but the Thermos brand still had ice cubes in it while mine did not... and the Thermos tumbler had been filled with ice and tea hours earlier.

Save your money and get a $5 cup that actually works.', \"I really like how long you can keep a beverage hot or cold with the magslider lid!  The magslider far outweighs Yeti's standard lid.\", \"I haven't yet evaluated the insulating properties, but I cannot comfortably drink out of the lid because the opening is too far below the top rim of the list to make a comfortable seal with my lips, but worse, my nose presses against the MagSlider, which makes drinking from it even more uncomfortable. Maybe this is not a problem for people with small noses, but I think I read others have had the same issue with the MagSlider. I haven't tried the regular lid--perhaps the opening is closer to the rim to be able to drink more comfortably without worrying about dribbling, and there is more room for your nose. I tested the lid for leaking, and I do not believe it leaks from the lid seal, but it does drip through the MagSlider, although I'm not that worried about that as the main purpose is to keep it from sloshing out when in the cup holder in the car, and I would think it would do that. I just ordered a YETI Lid with Straw and I'll see how that works. It occurred to me since I won't be using this lid for drinking from the opening, perhaps I can file out the middle of the inner side of the opening to create a rounded recess for a reusable straw. On the positive side, when I reported this problem to Amazon they issued me a full refund, even though they don't accept returns on this item, so I used a little over half of that refund to buy the lid with straw.\", 'Great mug!

Very easy to clean.', 'The YETI mug keeps all drinks Hot and other Cold for  as long as you are drinking', 'I got this cup for my husband, he loves it!', 'Keeps my coffee legitimately hot for hours.

This is my favorite travel mug!\", 'I love my Yeti, I use it all the time and the insulation is so good that I can leave it out overnight and in the morning it will still have ice cubes inside.

Because the magnet has no mechanical hinges, or grooves there is nothing to fatigue/wear out and nothing to catch. The magnetic lid alone makes it worth it. The shape of it is PERFECT.. not too big not to small and has a really nice gradual conintuous sweep/contour that makes it easy to grip and wont catch on anything and yet can fit in any car cup holder.
