"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","Looks nice, Doesn't keep coffee hot, Lid leaks, don't buy if you want to use it for hot liquids",1.0,"I received my Yeti 20oz with Mugslider lid. Looks great, well built. But after a hour or two, coffee is cold. While driving, the coffee will leak past the lid, and proceed to drip, all over your cars interior. I was hoping for something better. I also liked the information pamphlet that can with the cup talking about liquid viscosity, and how cold liquid is thicker, than hot, so hot liquid will have a tendency to leak around our Mugslider lids. Here's and idea, how about making a lid that doesn't leak when you put hot liquid in a cup???I digress, TLDR don't buy if you want to use it for hot liquid i.e. coffee."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",DO NOT BUY - COUNTERFEIT,1.0,Counterfeit piece of junk!  The rambler pictured shows the magnetic slider lid.  The rambler I received shipped from China and came with a cheap piece of plastic lid with no magnetic closure.  I do not believe the tumbler is even vacuum sealed as hot coffee turns cold in a matter of minutes.  It is deplorable that Amazon allows counterfeit sales like this.
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Not what the package says,1.0,"I ordered the Yeti Rambler 20 oz with the MagSlide Lid. Although the package description says “w/ MagSlide Lid”, the tumbler came with a regular lid. Very disappointing!"
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Fake Yeti Warnings Are Fake,5.0,"I was spooked by the warnings of ''Fake Yeti'' cups.  I don't think any of these are made in Texas any longer, although they once were, hence the warnings about fakes.  My local ACE Hardware sells the complete line of Yeti products.  I checked a bunch of those, and all were ''Fake'' according to some of these warnings.  I decided to order from Amazon simply so I could get the nice aqua-blue color -- and to get the nifty sliding cover, which my ACE does not carry.  The color is beautiful, and the sliding cover is nearly -- though not completely -- leak proof.  The cover seals well enough for my purposes, which is to rest in the truck cup holder.  Yeti makes cups with screw on tops which could be dropped into a backpack.  I could buy one of those from the local ACE if I ever need one.  Photo included.  Notice I have washed the YETI and have removed the cap so that it can evaporate and dry here on the kitchen counter-top in my photo."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Disappointed!,1.0,The product description states it is a yeti cup with a mag slider lid. All that was included was a cheap off brand plastic lid! I ordered two feeling I was getting the mag slider lid as well! Disappointed!
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","Great cup, great customer service",5.0,"My cup leaks. When I tilt the cup to take a sip the liquid gets under the lid and seal and drips all over me. I'm super bummed. The cup is Super pretty and keeps my cold coffee cold but I just dripped coffee down my shirt and it's not the first time.  I checked about exchanging it and apparently I'm a couple of days late for that. I'd buy this again if it weren't making a mess everywhere and ruining my clothes. I'm assuming this is a glitch because everybody else has such positive reviews. I emailed about an exchange, fingers crossed.EDIT: I wrote an email and got a very quick response. They sent me a new lid and it has changed my life. haha I could tell as soon as I put the lid on that it fit differently and it would seal. And it does! I love my cup, I love their customer service."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Not a magslider. Was also cracked.,1.0,"Came with two lids, but neither was the magslider and both were cracked. Overall, pretty unsatisfied."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Counterfeit,1.0,I purchased a few Yetis stateside which have the real mag slider. This mug is counterfeit from China.
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",You’ll be hooked and buy more,5.0,"Hesitated spending this amt of $$ on a mug especially considering the premium YETI name and outlandish pricing.I finally decided to part with my $$ thinking I’d be swindled by yet another clever marketing ploy. I was pleasantly surprised. Everything on the mug made sense build quality and it does exactly as the brands itself. Whether hot or cold, this mug holds temp for what seems like forever?My only gripe is that you can easily forget how well it maintains hot coffee even after sitting for an hour. So much that if not careful, you can burn your lips from the scalding temp of your coffee.The cleaning is simple and even the tlmfr’s name that this thing is so over-engineered that it can withstand dishwashers to keep it simple.Enjoyed it so much I purchased 6 more as gifts.Still questionable whether I’ll buy a $300 cooler, but the YETI brand has made me a believer."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Pretty darn fantastic,4.0,"This is a really great Tumbler-- it keeps the coffee hot/warm for hours, holds a lot of liquid, is super easy to clean, and really sleek looking.There are a couple of drawbacks, however.--If you have smaller hands, this particular one does not fit comfortably in your hand. This, paired with how heavy it is makes it somewhat difficult to hold during long commutes (mine is about an hour +).--Although it is pretty spill-proof, the top leaks a bit at the mouth portion, even with the magnetic closure closed. Granted, it doesn't spill over the edge, it's just slightly concerning to be on the bus/train and look down to see coffee bubbling up."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",A truly spilling experience.,2.0,"A great looking product that failed its most important operational test;  spillage.  The construction of the tumber is great.  The Yeti ""literature"" is great.  The lid just stinks.  The ""magnet"" concept slipped open during my first use and spilled 20% of my coffee over everything in my briefcase.  The Yeti was upright and securely wedged in place the entire journey, never turning upside down.  If you want to spend alot for a travel mug you can only use at the dinner table, this may work for you.  If you expect a bacic level of leak/spill protection, don't choose this one.  I imagine this would work well enough if you always have a cupholder.  I love the company, but this is a fail.2 stars, because I like the brand and the stainless piece is very high quality.PS - I also tried shaking it upside down with water, and had some additional minor leakage even with the lid secure.  Sad."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Love it!,5.0,This 20 oz. tumbler keeps my coffee hot for at least 4 hours.  After that it’s starts to cool a little. I take it to work everyday. Loved it so much bought one for my husband. I recommend this product
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","Finally, the perfect travel coffee mug!",5.0,"Yeah, Yeti vacuum products keep things hot or cold for ever.  But who wants coffee to be piping, burning hot for 5 hours.  I want to drink it in the morning!  That's not what makes this great but, yeah, it does keep it hot forever, yada yada.  What makes this great is the magnetic seal at the top - that is pure genius, people!  It pops right off easily for cleaning, doesn't trap nasty coffee goo and works better than any I've ever had.  Perfection.  And, yes, this mug keeps your coffee hot forever.  Or you can leave the top off for 10 mins like I do so you can drink it when you want...in the morning!"
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","Fake yeti ""patorpending""",1.0,"I've had this tumbler for a while, I never really liked it. It worked ok, but I thought that it just wasn't living up to the hype. Come to realize, it's not a real yeti tumbler. On the bottom, it says ""patorpending visit yeti.com/patorpending."" PAT OR PENDING. I'm laughing out loud. Anyways, don't waist your money!"
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Perfect!,5.0,"I have been using this for three months and can say without equivocation that it's the best tumbler I've ever had.  Does it keep my coffee hot?  Oh yeah -- for hours!  Is it durable?  Absolutely -- unbreakable, undentable, completely stainless.  Is it easy to clean?  Takes a few seconds.  Dark coffee, hot chocolate, tea, you name it -- it rinses out in seconds with zero staining.At first I thought that no tumbler could be worth this price, but now I am a huge fan.  I don't know if it will last forever, but I'm absolutely certain that I will get many years of use out of it."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",It leaks. Factory defect.,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I just received this Yeti yesterday. The lid is not leak-proof. There seems to be a hole in the underside of the lid. I uploaded a video. It appears to be a factory defect, or a mistake in the ways they plug the two holes on either side of the slide lid. I'll be returning this thing. I was hoping that spending so much money on one rambler would guarantee that I would get something of great quality. I really needed the lid to be leak-proof because this rambler is going into my fiance's lunch bag & it won't be set upright."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",never have I've been so disappointed with a purchase,1.0,"Not impressed at all! I've owned Yeti products for years, never have I've been so disappointed with a purchase! Both Rambler's I received a week ago already have fading spot's all over. They look absolutely hideous. The slider lids simply don't work. Even while completely closed, the lids release liquid. Either these Rambler's are poor quality knock-offs or Yeti has lowered their quality control standards and have begun to use cheaper processes during production. Even though this Amazon, I probably won't get a refund. The packaging was thrown away immediately after getting both of them. So, would I ever own another Yeti? Not very likely after this experience."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Love my YETI cup!,4.0,"Only just started drinking coffee (only took me 30 years) and my dad has a larger YETI mug, so I decided to try this one out.The Good: Decent size. Fits in my cup holder. Very stylish looking if I'm honest. Does keep drinking pretty hot/warm for a couple of hours (hard to test as I don't let drinks linger for too long). While the inside stays hot, the outside feels room temperature, not hot at all! Easy to drink from, I never feel like I'm about to spill it. The rubber between the top and the cup does a great job keeping the liquid in, and I've had no leaks from it. Siding has a decent grip to it, and my hand fits well around it, so I never feel like I'm going to drop it. The slider comes off and makes everything SUPER easy to clean, and it pops back and forth with ease, staying in it's proper place.The Bad: I REALLY wanted to give this thing 5 starts. I'd honestly give it a 4.5 if I could, but the one drawback concerning the magnetic slider (you can read my upsides about the slider above). The slider doesn't prevent leaking from an inverted cup. It DOES do a great job of ensuring your beverage doesn't jump up out of the cup if you hit a speed bump, and the liquid will come out a bit onto the top (which is set downward like a pool, so it doesn't actually leak down the side of the cup or anything). But it doesn't prevent full leakage if the cup were to topple over. Still, it's ONE drawback about an amazing product.I very much recommend this cup!!! I've been using it daily since I bought it, and may buy another as a gift when the winter comes around."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","The lid is designed to be splash proof, not leak proof.",5.0,"I was skeptical about this tumbler based on the reviews and pictures I saw here but I’m very happy with mine. Love the color and my coffee stays warm from the first sip to the last. I also like the lid. People here complain that it leaks but it’s not designed to be leak proof, just splash proof. I like that I can remove it easily to clean it throughly. Mine arrived in perfect condition. I would recommend it."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Works better than advertised,5.0,"Writing on behalf of my wife: This mug keeps her Starbucks drink cold all day. Which is good because it takes her all day to drink it. Funny thing is, she still doesn’t finish the entire beverage. She used to complain that the reason she never finished the cold Starbucks brew is because it would get to warm, well let me tell you, she doesn’t have that issue any more. ALTHOUGH THE BEVERAGE STAYS ICE COLD- she still cannot manage to finish an entire beverage.. which ultimately will be poured down the drain. By myself, when I do the dishes at night. I can’t wait to hear the new excuse for why she’s unable to finish these expensive Starbucks beverages. Which literally go to waste. Every day. But at least it does indeed keep it cold from when it’s filled up in the morning to late at night when I pour it all down the drain. She says it doesnt work as well with hot beverages but still pretty good nonetheless. Hotter than if you were to use any traditional mug. So it is basically like a thermos."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",YETI doesn't warranty Amazon purchases,1.0,"I own multiple YETI products, and this is the first issue I've had with one of their products.  Water was seeping out from where the base meets the rest of the mug.  I tugged on the base and it came off in my hands, and there was water that got in there, probably from the dishwasher.  The base will not reattach, and was pressure sealed.  I called Yeti yesterday, waited on hold for over an hour, and then was told that this was not uncommon and to fill out their warranty claim online.  I did so, and included the same pics you see here.  Here's the response:Hi Ron!Thanks for reaching out to YETI.We are sorry to hear about your experience. Based off the information you have provided it appears as though your tumbler was customized using a 3rd party customization process which is not covered directly under our warranty. That said, we recommend contacting the original seller in order to inquire on their specific warranty related information.To ensue you are always receiving authentic YETI gear, we recommend purchasing directly from YETI.com or from one of our authorized retailers you may find at the bottom of our site under “store locator.”Thanks for reaching out to us, and we will be sure to pass this information along to our brand protection team.Best regards,The YETI Outfitterseniquer512.394.9384customerservice@yeti.comThere was no third party customization.  Their response was bizarre.  I am posting this here because I bought this on Amazon, and am apparently out of luck because I didn't buy it on yeti.com, or an authorized retailer."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","It's a YETI, it works for keeping stuff cold, and the MagSlider is overdue for YETI",5.0,"I have a few YETI ramblers that have been given to me by various companies, thus they all have the branding and logos for those companies.  They all work well for keeping my drinks, almost always ice water, cold.  This one is no different.  Here in Houston, I can have it with two large cubes, with me in and out of the car all day, multiple water refills, sitting in the heat, and by the time I have made it home there are still two, albeit smaller, ice cubes.I am not sure if it just a perception thing, but I don't think this particular rambler does as well as my other, all silver, YETI 20oz.  It seems like the silver one does an even better job at keeping things cold, but maybe I am just imagining that.  Either way, I am happy."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Nearly perfect,5.0,"Overall I'm happy with this rambler with a few minor gripes. I did a lot of research and watched countless comparison and review videos on YouTube to decide between this or the competition.While other brands have been proven to keep hots hot and colds cold for longer durations of time, this rambler is easier to to open for drinking and easier to dismantle for cleaning.Everyone has a different opinion on what temperature they consider hot and what temperature they consider cold. For myself I've found that this rambler works better for hots opposed to colds.Ice doesnt seem to last more than 1 to 2 hours even if the Beverage poured in is already cold from the fridge.18 to 20 oz of hot black coffee will still be warm 7 to 8 hours later if I do not touch it until that 7 hour mark. Everytime I open the lid to drink, some heat gets released thus bringing down the temperature.From what I've seen on YouTube and read here on Amazon, it seems like theres a 50/50 shot if someone gets a good lid or a great lid. Yeti advertises the mag lid as being spill ""resistant"", not spill ""proof"".Here's what it comes down to, the sliding magnet cover. Some videos show this rambler being held upside down with not even a drop leaking. Other videos show liquid leaking from the sliding magnet.Absolutely nothing leaks through the inner gasket around the lid which is great. Mine does unfortunately leak from the magnet sliding cover.If yeti could figure out how design the lid to guarentee the sliding magnet would not leak and it would hold temperature for just a few more hours, then I believe yeti could have a monopoly on the market."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",It’s a receptacle for holding liquids!!!,5.0,"Thank you Yeti for inventing this amazing device. I was getting tired of lapping my Kool-Aid off the floor.- Appears to keep things cold, but I don’t usually keep drinks in the same cup for 24 hours in direct sunlight because I’m not an insane person.- Appears to not leak, but I’m proud to report that I haven’t had a problem keeping cups upright since about age 5, except for a brief period between age 19 and 22.- When I drink from this cup other men know I’m an alpha and women can detect that I’m good mating potential because of my obvious manliness.- On a serious note, the magnetic lid is very nice because it allows you to clean it properly. Yeti, you may have 1 extra caramel."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Poor lid design.  Doesn’t keep beverage hot.,1.0,"Not happy with it’s insulating capabilities.  The Contigo travel mug I bought at Target works better!!  Bad lid design. Not worth 30 bucks for sure. And I bought 7 of these as gifts for all my adult kids because everyone raves about what a great product YETI is.  YETI should redesign the lid, and then offer a free replacement to everyone who bought this particular mug."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Thoroughly Impressed!,5.0,"I wasn't necessarily a huge skeptic, but I did wonder what all the hype was about. After using this almost daily, it definitely lives up to its reputation. I love the simple look and it actually does hold the temperature inside incredibly well. I use this as a bring-my-own-cup option at coffee shops and it has the added benefit of keeping the coffee hot for hours. I  also love that the sip cover is magnetic and comes off - which makes it easier to clean and feel good that nothing is getting stuck in that small space. I love it!"
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Overall very pleased.,5.0,"I’ll start by saying that I held off on buying these for about a year now. I had assumed that it was more of a trend kinda thing and the experience was being exaggerated. Officially, I’d say I was wrong.All in all, it’s a great product and works really well at keeping drinks cold and slowing melting ice substantially. We bought two of these a couple weeks ago right before our trip to Mexico. It was about 95* with a “Real Feel” of about 105*. We had our drinks in these out in the sun and it took the ice a good 3 hours or so to melt completely in that temperature. Even after the ice melted, the drink stayed reasonably cool for another hour or two. Cold beer in them stayed cold long enough for me to finish the whole thing.Overall, I’d say I’m quite pleased. I will note though, I did some research (after purchasing) and only certain products (and not all) are made overseas. If you’re looking to buy a US made product, you have to contact them and request it specifically, or go with a different brand. If that’s important to you, do your research first or contact them."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Impressive performance,4.0,"Authentic Yeti. I tested it immediately upon receipt and here are the test results: I poured boiling water into it and checked after 3 hours to find it still piping hot that could give you a burn. I repeated the test, this time, only fill the tumbler to half to test how it performs with only half the volume. The water is still very, very hot after 5 hours. It's temperature dropped a bit after 6 hours, but it's still quite hot. I could still feel a bit of warmth after another 11 hours!It's amazing how a little tumbler can keep liquid hot for so long. It performs way better than my Swell water bottle and it's way cheaper than a Swell.One thing is that the packing isn't that good . I think probably for that reason, it came with a small dent on the rim. I could actually feel the Yeti wobbled like crazy inside the box when it arrived. I would have given it a 5-star if it wasn't for the dent.Before I decide to go ahead and buy, I read the review here and noticed a number of people said they've bought a fake Yeti. The thing is, Yeti Authorized is the only authorized seller on Amazon according to Yeti's website. So if you choose to buy from other sellers, the authenticity will be uncertain. And don't choose colors like olive, camouflage, cos they are not colors shown on Yeti's website, meaning they are not really made by Yeti but some knock off. Hope it helps."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Excellent,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Great with coffee, beer, and water, which are really the only things I drink with it. Love the magnetic lid piece and that it is leak-proof. When there is boiling water in the cup it is never so hot that you can't hold it."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Not leak proof,3.0,"I love Yeti products, and was honestly disappointed with this mug. After reading the directions I realized that the lid is not at all leak proof, especially with hot liquids. Even the lid itself has a manufacturers note that it’s not the best at keeping hot liquids in. Knowing all that, I tried just plain water with some ice, and kept the tumbler closed upright in a cooler. To my dismay, by the time we walked over front he car to the beach all of the tumbler contents have spilled all over the cooler. For a good product I just don’t understand why would YETI not make a leak proof lid? I’m terribly disappointed because I can’t imagine myself taking this tumbler anywhere except into my car for morning coffee and leaving it on my desk. It would be impossible to leave it in a backpack because it will definitely spill. I’m not sure if the lids I have are just totally defective, but seeing that the label on the tumbler warned against spills I’m suspicious that it’s just not a great lid.If you’re looking for a spill proof tumbler, this one sadly is not it :/"
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Not a YETI magslider lid,1.0,"I love YETI, but the magslider lid that was promised is all clear and not a YETI lid.  The lid is very cheaply made and does not stay closed. Returning item"
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",ONLY buy from seller Yeti Authorized!,5.0,"For those concerned about counterfeit Yeti I figured out how some reviewers possibly received fake items and others didn’t. Different colors of the tumbler have different sellers but all are sold under the same item listing. Anyone who buys the item reviews in the same place. The seller Yeti Authorized definitely sells real Yeti items. For example the tumbler I bought from Yeti Authorized is real. It came with the “register your Yeti” booklet and the scannable square barcode thingy (I forget what it’s called) sticker on the bottom. It’s also heavy-ish and clearly has an acrylic lid with the mag slider. So when buying Yeti off amazon you need to buyer beware and check the seller of the item. I’m not suggesting that Yeti Authorized is the only seller of real Yeti on amazon. I’m saying that I received a real tumbler from them AND a seller with the brand name in its seller name is much more likely to be selling real items, according to research I did on counterfeit goods on amazon.Aside from that my tumbler is great. It’s definitely a quality item but at $30 I don’t expect something completely indestructible. Unlike some reviews I don’t put mine in the dishwasher. Also I don’t see how it’s necessary to do so given that mine always rinses/washes nicely. One thing to keep in mind is that this tumbler works so well that *too hot* coffee will stay too hot in the Yeti for hours. So a few times I’ve had to take the lid off to let it cool. All in all I’d say it’s worth the $30. I’m planning on getting the larger tumbler with straw and the larger bottle for the summer."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Not Worth It,2.0,"I bought these because the Contigo coffee mugs I had were staining pretty bad and leaving a bad taste in my coffee.  There's so much hype about these Yeti's and I can't tell you how disappointed I am.  First, they make this big hoopla about the magnet top.  Its worthless.  Yes, they say ""made from real magnets"", like, woohoo, who cares?  the Contigo lock locks.  it keeps things from pouring out.  This magnet acts like a passive suggestion to the coffee to stay put.  The contigo comes with a rubber-like wrap that helps with grip.  The Yeti is so smooth they might as well have made the outside from vaseline.  It doesnt keep coffee as warm as long as Contigo, which i attribute to the weak magnetic slide.  I am hoping at the very least the metal inside doesn't stain like the Contigo.  In short, if I hadn't had the contigo (cheaper than these and come in pairs at Costco) my review would be better.  This mug isn't bad, its just knowing how much better the competition is makes this look worse."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Gets cold quick and leaks terribly,1.0,"A full 20 oz cup of scalding hot coffee cooled to lukewarm in 2.5 hours sitting unopened on a table inside a warm room.  Lid leaks profusely when closed. Hot coffee doesn’t drip or slowly leak, it literally gushes out the closed lid in a 2” long stream...through a CLOSED LID.  Unlike Yeti’s enclosed explanation of liquid viscosity suggesting hot fluids are more likely to leak than cold fluids, having a 2” long stream of hot coffee gushing out of a closed lid does not even happen in my much less expensive Target brand Chinese thermal cups."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Very Impressed!,5.0,"I am not into designer labels, big names, etc. but I love this tumbler.  I can see why this brand is superior to the ""knock-offs"".  First of all, it doesn't have any interior seams. Second, it is dishwasher safe. Third, it comes with a serial number that is registered with the manufacturer and has a 5 year warranty.  The lid is extremely easy to open and close with the flip of a thumb - essential if you're going to use this while driving.  I am extremely pleased - so much so that I bought another one."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","Wow, pretty awful",1.0,"The info that came w the tumbler said that the lid is not leakproof. OK, understood. What I don’t understand is how it can leak when it’s in your hand and you’re standing still. I imagined it wouldn’t be leak proof if it’s in the truck and you’re off roading but when the act of standing in one place and trying to drink makes it leak it seems like a failed product.It doesn’t keep hot drinks hot the way my cheap Contigo brand tumbler does. There needs to be something around it to grip because it’s just slick stainless steel and it can slide from your hand easily. Do not even try opening the lid once you have a hot drink in there. Just don’t. Or wear an apron and do it in the sink because you have to force the lid open.$30. My no name tumbler from Walgreens is far superior."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",The perfect mug for a coffee snob!!,5.0,"Let me start by explaining I am a coffee snob. I usually purchase end up purchasing expensive coffee. But I can’t drink it before I work out.  And it sucked when I would finish my workout and find that my “insulated” coffee mug only kept it lukewarm.  Ruined my coffee. No longer. Enter the Yeti. This thing keeps my coffee crazy hot.  I also drink a ton of tea. I have to be careful using my Yeti mug because the first time I seriously burned the roof of my mouth and tongue. After I had let it sit on my desk for half an hour.  I was suffering through a cold and put my tea on my bedside table, sipping it when I started to cough. It was still warm in the morning ( not hot, but certainly warmer than room temperature). I don’t have to work outside, but if I did, this is the mug I would want."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Leaked.  So I was sad because I really wanted it to work.,1.0,"Leaked and decided to go back to a cups I can buy at Target.I had really hoped that I would have a good experience because the packaging, size, and all of the features it was supposed to have really attracted me.At the end of the day though it would leak when I used it to drink out of.For the price I'm not going to Monkey around I just returned it and headed off to Target. The cups I buy at Target aren't as cute but they don't leak on me."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Awesome Totally Worth It,5.0,"I got a new job and was using a random coffee tumbler for a while. My drive is about an hour long and I drink about half of my coffee on the way to work and the other half there. Issue was my coffee would be lukewarm once I got to work, and sometimes I would make tea later on and it wouldn’t stay warm for over an hour. I decided to get a yeti after using my moms one day and noticing the difference in temperature and longevity. Absolutely worth it. I’ve been using it at home on weekends as well. I live in new england so the house is usually cold in the morning during these months and coffee in a regular mug only stays hot for 10 minutes or so before going tepid. I normally have to put my coffee in the microwave 3 or 4 times just to keep it warm, but the yeti keeps it piping hot for hours and I can take my time sipping on it. Overall so happy and impressed with this product."

"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Not leak proof...,3.0,"While fine print clarifies it’s not leak proof, principally purchased to have a leak proof tumbler. Fully admit I presumed for $30 and being Yeti...  it’d be leak proof.  So lesson learned: even if you have a perception of a particular brand...  still pays to do your research. If it’s knocked over, even with lid sealed, it’ll leak. Not a river, but enough to ruin paper, soil carpet, get whatever’s inside on electronics. Otherwise, it’s as advertised. It’d be nice if the lack of leakproofing and what spillproof means were more prominently displayed/ discussed/ clarified. Judging from other’s comments, it appears this is a common misconception (or source of misunderstanding)."

I haven't tried anything cold, so that I can't speak to. But!, I love it.  (I bought a good one from starbucks years ago, and lost it, was never able to replace it--they changed something...) This is better, by far! Except for the leak proof feature. I love the lid, with the removable glider, for easier cleaning.  After, I purchased it, I was so thrilled with it, I bought one for my daughter. If you're going to get the 30 oz, I recommend purchasing the handle as well, unless your hands are large or opt for the 20 oz. Almost perfect!"
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Test results were surprising,4.0,Bought this for my husband as a surprise thinking it would be better than the no name stainless steel I use. Was very disappointed when I tested the same number of ice cubes in each and left them on the counter overnight. The Yeti had water with no ice and my no name had two ice cubes in it the next morning.  I was quite surprised so don’t really think it’s worth the extra money just for the name.
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Good performer but not leakproof,3.0,"I wanted to love my Yeti Rambler, but it failed at the one most important thing I bought it for. Yes, it is well made, strong, attractive and keeps things hot/cold a really long time, but unfortunately the magslide top isn’t leakproof. I bought this to use on the go and be confident that if it got knocked over, it wouldn’t leak. Unfortunately, it fails that test.I know other reviewers mentioned that it’s not leakproof, but I made the mistake of seeing it a local store where the salesgirl assured me that magslide lids are indeed leakproof...should have done more research.I require something that’s easy to open/close with one hand even when you’re being bounced around in turbulence, and if it tips over, I can’t have it spilling all over my vehicle. Sadly, this Yeti isn’t that, and the price is high for just another insulated coffee cup."

Considering the price and all the ""hoopla"" that comes with the Yeti name, you would think they could make this leak proof.  I guess I was hoping it would be but the enclosed information clearly states ""leak resistant"".  Even that is a stretch.  It leaks.  The outer layer is slippery and the tumbler is wide so holding it isn't easy."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Fantastic insulated cup,5.0,I recently received the 20oz rambler stainless steel color for a birthday gift. I've had other insulated mugs but this one just puts the competition to shame. On how long the rambler keeps the coffee hot. Yes I said HOT like fresh out of the pot hot for well over two hours. My wife was so impressed with the Yeti that I surprised her with one in Brick Red she loves it. I think the slide on the lid helps out a lot keeping the beverage hot.
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",REAL Yeti is great - but make sure you get the real thing,5.0,"These are awesome, if you get the real thing. Be aware -I purchased 10 Yeti Rambler 20 Oz for a group event. Five of them were fake. The 3 Tahoe Blue ones were obvious. The logo on the mag slider lid was way off, and the whole lid was so poorly constructed the slider didn't only not seal, it would just fall off.  The two Olive Green from the same seller are an improved version - knock-off 2.0. Better, but still lacking quality. The lid almost fooled me into thinking it was real, but was still not quite right. I noticed neither lid had anything stamped on the underside, like the real Yeti. The logo on the front was also off, smaller, wrong font, and the way imprinted shows a definite lack of quality compared to the real thing, the bottom logo too. The sticker font was wrong and obviously fake, and they came with a cheap card inside instead of a full color brochure. The fake ones came in boxes, while the real thing comes with plastic protectors, and wrapped in a plastic bag.I am returning the 5 fakes and left a negative review for the seller. I purchased 5 from the local Dicks Sporting Goods today, and compared them to the five sold by ""Yeti Authorized"" on Amazon - and indeed those appear real."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Received wrong color,1.0,"I love yeti, but the wrong color arrived and I had to pay the postage to return it, and then couldn’t get a replacement before Christmas. Not great."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","An expensive, leaky failure. Premium price for subpar design.",1.0,"I bought the 20 oz Rambler and the separate handle as a gift and am deeply regretting all of it. Yes it insulates the beverage for a while, but seriously, all double walled vacuum tumblers do that these days, and the truth is the cheaper Chinese knockoffs that cost half as much do it just as well as Yeti does. So I knew I would be paying extra for the fit and finish and for what I figured would be a better designed lid in the ""new"" MagSlider lid. The fit and finish is top notch, the powder Duracoat looks great and very durable, and the lid looked to be excellent as well. Looking closer, it seemed the MagSlider lid has a wonderful double rubber flange on it that seems perfect for sealing liquids inside and preventing messy accidents. Great so far!Everything seemed wonderful, except that in use, the MagSlider lid actually leaks even in the closed position. Worse yet, this doesn't even seem to be a defective product, just a simple design flaw, in the sense that they surprisingly failed to account for the fact that consumers would want their liquid containers to actually contain the liquid inside them and not allow them to leak out when in any position besides exactly vertical. Apparently, Yeti thinks that for $30 you should expect nothing more than gravity to keep your coffee from spilling out of your Rambler.So, why? Why would you design a premium priced tumbler that utterly FAILS at one of the simplest tasks you demand from a liquid container? Even the cheap Chinese knockoffs at a third of the price have being leakproof as a basic quality. What good are the premium materials and lovely powder coat Duracoat finish if this thing leaks like crazy when it inevitably falls over? I really don't understand why the crack Yeti design team couldn't design a better lid at this price point for something they market as suitable for an active outdoors life. This design isn't suitable for a boring morning highway commute to an office cubicle though, let alone a day of getting knocked around on a work site or a boat.I had a similar experience with the Yeti Colster, which is $25 and two pieces for the simple task of keeping a can cold. Meanwhile a Thermos can cooler is $5, one piece, weighs significantly less, and keeps a can exactly as cold as the vastly overdesigned Yeti Colster.It really feels like they don't know what they're doing down there at Yeti HQ. Honestly, how do you manage to serially OVERdesign products yet UNDERdesign them at the same time? I'm highly disappointed in this company, as a premium priced product they should not be failing the basics of everyday utility. The Rambler is supposed to be one of their signature products. Before this I was considering buying one of their extremely spendy coolers, but I've completely struck that from my mind. Between this tumbler/lid and the Colster they've fooled me twice now, but they won't be fooling me again. Goodbye Yeti!"

"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Best ever!,4.0,"I am a coffee junkie. Truly. As such, I’ve been through an alarming number of both travel mugs and water jugs over the years. Trudeau, Zojirushi (2), Contigo, along with the standard brands. You name it and I’ve tried it. This is my first Yeti. If I’d known earlier I’d have bought it one or more likely two years ago and would probably still have it.The good: I don’t have large hands, but this is still easy to hold. The finish isn’t slippery and seems to have a bit of grip to it. Coffee (hot or cold), cider, just about anything stays hot or cold as long as it lasts.It’s incredibly easy to clean. The magnets on the lid are an inspiration. That the slide comes off for cleaning is another one.The bad: the lid is really the only drawback. It doesn’t give much insulation and doesn’t screw in. All these things make for easy cleaning, but also deplete its heat and cold retention.My husband was making fun of my new coffee mug the very instant he saw that lid. As he was washing it out he put the lid on, flipped it over and started shaking it. Luckily the sipper slide was closed. Probably he thought he could get the lid to fall off. It didn’t. It did lose some water through the sipper, but not as much as he or I thought. He kept laughing and shaking. He got over the laughing. Now he wants one when his breaks.I noticed they make an alternate cap for the ramblers. I wish they made that same style cap for the tumblers. The bottles are really too big or too small for coffee, the main thing I use this for, naturally.I’m sure I’ll be back with another star in a few months.Mine came from Yeti Authorised, shipped by Amazon and if it’s a knockoff it’s a darn good one. But I’m sure it’s not.I hope these ramblings are helpful to someone. Thank you. 🙏"
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",All-Around Competent,5.0,"It's easy to see why these are so popular, and why they're not usually discounted. This travel tumbler does everything right, as far as I can tell.1. It keeps my coffee hot for four hours. That's past the point where the coffee becomes rancid and undrinkable, so full marks.2. It's cool to the touch even when the contents are boiling hot. Full marks.3. It fits perfectly and remains stable in the cup holder of my 2015 Subaru Forester, yet is still easily removable. Full marks.4. The lid is easy to attach and remove. It always secures completely, with no ""seems tight but really isn't."" It doesn't leak in normal use (I include not overfilling it as a condition of ""normal""). It's easy to open and close the slider, and that doesn't leak either. Full marks.5. The whole thing washes nicely in the dishwasher.6. The optional handle works really well, is comfortable and balanced, and stays on even though it's just a pressure fit.So in my own use, it's pretty much perfect. Except that it's so expensive that I'm afraid to take it outside the car or my house. Maybe that just means I'll be more careful with it."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Love the look. Lid could be better.,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Love the look of the mug/tumbler.  Kept my coffee hot for a 2-3 hours, which is good enough for my use.  The lid is made of clear plastic, so can’t expect super insulation.  Plus, the coffee doesn’t taste as good anyway after a couple hours, so it’s good enough for my use.I did see the complaints of the lid in the reviews before I bought it.  Liked the look of it and the brand so I decided to test it out for myself.First, the magnet is not very strong, which makes the usability smooth but doesn’t make a tight seal.Second, the slide sip cover is just hard plastic so it wouldn’t make a tight seal anyway.  So it ended up letting some coffee out not during my drive but after I walked with it fir a couple minutes.  See the picture.  Maybe I wasn’t too careful with it but I didn’t put it upside down or shook it intentionally.  Just normal carry.YETI claims it’s not leak-proof, and perhaps it was never designed to be - probably to ease the manufacturing process and cut cost. I understand that.However, this product could’ve been awesome if the lid has some sealing component to it and stronger magnet to keep it closed tight.Overall, though, it’s a good-looking mug that I’ll keep and enjoy using. I didn’t expect leak-proof so just took off 1 star as the lid still could be better given the YETI brand."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","Basically perfect. Easy to clean, Excellent for Cold, Decent for Hot. Not leak-proof, but decently splash-proof.",5.0,"I am tired - SO TIRED - of tumbler mugs with complicated lids that are IMPOSSIBLE to clean. Let me just state outright that from that perspective alone, the ""magslider"" lid is a work of genius. There's no spring, no latch, no hinge, no tiny crevasses or nooks. You can take the slider off whenever you want and clean underneath it, but otherwise it stays in place extremely well.The downside of the lid is that it's not at all leakproof. It's scarcely even dribble proof. No, what it's really going to accomplish is that it keeps your drink from splashing out onto things when you hit a bump or jostle it accidentally. That's fine - keep the thing upright - but if they ever make an iteration of this lid that holds up to being inverted without leaking I will spend whatever they charge.Now, as for the tumbler itself, it works as advertised. The vacuum insulation works amazingly well for cold drinks. Ice lingers for hours. Hot drinks? It does okay. I've had Thermos brand products that kept hot drinks piping for 24 hours, while the Yeti will manage a quarter of that. The weak link is really the lid - heat rises and the lid isn't a full seal (as mentioned above). Heat can/will escape readily to the point where about 4 hours into my workday my once piping-hot coffee is now drink-ably warm. There are worse things, I suppose. Get this one mainly for cold drinks, but know it's suitable for anything.The powder coating is very nice and unlike enameled tumblers it seems like it will last. It provides a nice amount of grip as well, being somewhat roughly textured. I've covered mine in some vinyl stickers for a bit of character, but you could probably get them laser etched as well (like the Yeti logo is on the side).All in all, the only regret I have is not stepping up to the 32oz size for $5 more."

I love the olive green color though. You’d think YETI would make a leak free lid, or at least the tiniest bit better than the lid without the magnet.Ok somehow a line of rust has shown up in my cup. I’ve had it for a very short period of time. I don’t know how this could have happened, i did try and scrub it out. ill need to exchange it 🙁"
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Really High Quality,5.0,"It’s everything I was looking for. It’s strong and has a good weight to it. Even with scalding hot coffee inside, you cannot feel the heat while holding the outside of the container. As some people mentioned it is not entirely spill proof, so if you hold it upside down with the slider closed, coffee will comeback out, but if you knock it over and pick it up quickly nothing comes out, and if you knock it over and don’t react fast enough, it will spill slowly enough to not ruin anything (as long as you clean up the drips right away).A tip for people who like to fill it to the top: If you think you may have filled it a little too much to put the lid on, have the slider on the lid closed when you put the lid on. If it’s slightly over full and the slider’s closed, coffee will bubble up through the slider a little bit but stay in the top of the lid. If it’s slightly over full and the slider’s open, coffee will shoot up a few feet into the air.Another tip: Be aware of how hot your coffee is before taking a sip. Especially when you’re used to feeling the temperature from the outside of a cup, the heat-proofness can lull you into a false sense of security, and then you can burn your mouth, so think before you sip fresh coffee."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Another Great Product From Yeti!,5.0,Overall this is a very high quality product from Yeti. The construction overall is great keeps drinks cold or hot for the advertised amount of time with high quality vacuum sealed steel. The only Cons I would have is the mag slider doesn't seal for protection against leaks which would make this product top knotch. The price point overall is decent compared to the quality Tumblr that you are getting.
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Not Impressed with the MagSlider Lid.,2.0,"I'm not a Yeti snob, I have some RTIC stuff and find them comparable. I do however enjoy using my Yeti 18oz tumbler with chug top every day for water at work and after my Stanley vacuum pushbutton top thermos started leaking, I was in the market for a new coffee cup. My requirements are that it keeps coffee warm for 3-4 hours and doesn't leak/spill coffee from the top. I don't intend on throwing my thermos/cups in a bag and letting them turn upside down, but I need them to not leak when transporting to work and driving around. Well, this MagSlider lid really isn't a good design. It's a cool concept and makes for easy washing but it leaks like crazy. I understand it is advertised as ""slosh proof"" and not ""leak proof"", but even a gentle sloshing around spills coffee out of the top as if that mag slider lid wasn't even there! It made a huge mess when I tried using it so unfortunately I had to return it. It also didn't keep my coffee warm for longer than 2 hours. I did however place an order for another Yeti 18oz tumbler (which I assume is the same one I use for water), but with the hotshot cap which is advertised as leak proof. I'm hoping this will both keep my coffee warm for 3-4 hours and keep from leaking."

"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",A very good travel mug,4.0,"It's a fine insulated cup.First, the good:Materials appear to be of the advertised quality.The polycarbonate lid is crystal clear, glossy, and beautiful.The lid fits tightly.The sliding magnetic drinking hole cover has a tactilely pleasant action.The sliding cover, cleverly, has hidden air displacement porting that closes when the cover is closed. It keeps the lid clean-looking and presumably reduces leakage when the lid is closed.The lid's mold lines are thoughtfully laid out so that they do not interfere with the lens-like main window into the cup.It has a pleasant weight and fits comfortably in my hand. The powder coat provides adequate grip and is pleasant to touch.The replacable gasket seats on the sidewall of the lid rather than in a place where it could get pinched and leak. The gasket also has a double seal.And the could-be-better or disappointing:The ""canyon red"" is closer to a tomato red than the highly saturated and contrast-adjusted product photo suggests. I was expecting this cup to visually pop. I'd buy a different color given the chance.The steel is not as lustrous and smooth looking as it appears in product photos. It's duller, with a coarse brushed finish.The steel near the rolled top of the cup has some marring, though it isn't as noticable with the lid on.The top edge of the powder coating is noticably uneven.My tumbler came with a tiny piece of debris in the powder coat.Other notes:The sliding drinking-hole cover doesn't perfectly mate to the edge of the lid. There is a small but visible gap when the lid is closed, and the lid will leak if tipped over while closed. This may have been an intentional design choice to allow venting of vapor so the lid doesn't explode off when the container is full of hot liquid and shaken.Mine arrived with a small ding in the steel base. I'm not counting this against it, because I expect it'll get even more dinged up and survive, but if you're obsessive you might care.Overall, it's a high quality and thoughtfully designed insulated tumbler, but I was disappointed with some of the details that in my opinion didn't live up to the hype. I would buy it again."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",The best option for daily coffee drinkers,5.0,"This was our first Yeti purchase and is incredible.  I’ve used it everyday for three years and it’s made every other coffee thermos useless.  As you can see from the pictures, the mug itself still looks brand new.  The lid is slightly worn from daily hand washing, but still performs great.Pros:- Simple, 4-piece design.  You can clean it most days in less than a minute.  The mag slider pops off easily during cleaning.  We use the magnet feature store our lids against the sides of our stainless drying rack so we know exactly where to find it the next morning.- Heat!  With the slider closed, this keeps coffee hot for hours.  Even after 7-8 hours the coffee is still very warm.- Performance.  This fits in car cup holders perfectly, and is easy to grasp.  The black metal sides are grippable.  The slider prevents liquid from leaking out when walking or transferring.  It’s not “leak proof” but did hold 99% of the liquid the few times it was dropped or tipped over.  The slide makes it very easy to drink and re-seal, and I wouldn’t want the daily use of something required to be “leak-proof.”Cons:- The rubber o-ring seal around the lid is the only design flaw.  It traps coffee and moisture and needs to be cleaned at least monthly.  That area gets gross and you can see it build up through the clear lid.  I clean it by carefully using a butter knife to pry it out and then scrubbing the seal and the lid.  I’m not deducting the review because I don’t have any ideas on how to do this better, and haven’t found another, better option.Buy this and you won’t be disappointed.  We give them as gifts to family who love hot coffee."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","Incredible product, worth every penny!",5.0,"I ordered mine from YETI Authorized and it was an authentic product and I was able to easily register it through the official YETI site. I see some complaining that they received a bootleg item, YETI says on their site in the faq section that the only seller on Amazon that is authorized by them and covered by their warranty is the seller ""YETI Authorized"", so if you plan on buying on here, you should definitely should take that into consideration.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. Was looking to upgrade to a better travel coffee mug. I previously had a ceramic one with a silicone cover, and it wasn't ideal for me. I like this one a lot because it's made of stainless steel & has a double chamber, which keeps the contents hot/cold, but still stays the same temp outside where you hold it, so your hands won't even feel the difference. Really does help at keeping the contents the right temp, I had a hot cup of coffee and it stood hot the entire time I drank it & continued to fill it, over the span of several hours.I really like the lid with the mag slide. The lid, itself, doesn't leak any, though the mag slide (the cover that goes over the drinking hole) does leak just a tiny bit while it's closed, if tipped to the side, but I don't plan on storing it in a bag or anything, anyway, so it doesn't bother me. Still figured it was good for others to know in case they were looking for an entirely leak proof system.It's very easy to clean & dries fast. I was surprised to find that the outside is painted stainless steel because, based on the photos, I thought it was going to be silicone coated, or something like that. So I was originally hesitant to buy white, because I thought coffee and dirt would stain it pretty fast, but now I can tell there shouldn't be any issue with staining.I also purchased the straw lid to go with this and definitely plan on buying a few of these as gifts in the future!"

And I figured Yeti for the outdoors was kinda like man-buns and bragging rights - why spend $10 when you can spend $30, right?Man, was that shallow, or what. What I found out was, in terms of Yeti, you pay for first class you get first class, and then some.I don’t care if it’s a camping ice box, drink container, or men’s hair berets - if it’s a Yeti, it’s the best. By far. (And, no, Yeti doesn’t make hair berets.)Everything pales in comparison to Yeti. I don’t know if they use Thanos level refrigeration technology or what, but if you want it warmer longer or colder longer and I mean WAY longer, Yeti is what you need.Period. End of story. Look no further. Yeti is IT."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Keeps your coffee hot for an inexplicably long length of time!,5.0,"I’m not gonna lie-I thought this was going to be a fraud as soon as I saw that the lid was clear plastic.  Don’t know a lot about heat transfer, but uninsulated clear plastic doesn’t seem to be the best material to choose while designing a cup that claims to keep my coffee hot all day. Well, I was wrong. It keeps my coffe hot all day! I just think I may have overfilled it-I had a little spill when I first used it. But not from the seal-it just drew some coffee over the seal when I put the lid on. I am really impressed!"
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","Received authentic Yeti Rambler - spill resistant mug slider, not spill proof",5.0,"There's a lot of reviews here claiming they received a fake, but I took a chance and I received the authentic Yeti Tumbler. I noticed that you can switch to buy from a different 3rd party seller through this amazon page and some of them are selling it below the manufacturer price of 29.99. That might be why they are getting fakes? Anyway, I got the navy blue yeti tumbler and it came with the mug slider. Couldn't be happier. I already have one at home and it keeps my beverage cold for hours even on a hot day, hence why I decided to get another.Note that mug slider lids are spill resistant and not spill proof, which is clearly mentioned on the packaging. On their website, Yeti also points out in a video that the mug slider will still have spillage if you tip it upside down, it only prevents side way spills by covering the lid, it is not a spill proof lid."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",The cups are authentic please look at pictures that I posted,5.0,I love the size of yeti cups I didn’t have this color keep in mind though it is very light pink . I have read the comments about the yeti cups being fake ....not true these are 100% authentic yeti cups. As you can see in my picture I have quite a few I’m a big fan of these types of cups because they’re just the right size and I like lids on my cups also a couple of these came from Dick’s Sporting Goodsso do not be afraid to buy these cups these are 100% yeti cups. If you own yeti cups then expect the quality of the brand. Great by the pink ice is the new favorite.
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","Great product, but competition is stiff",5.0,"Just purchased this so I'd have a smaller size insulated tumbler.  I have two much bigger ones from a lesser known brand at a big box store.  After using this for a few days, I think it's safe to say that the Yeti and the off-label brand do an equally good job at retaining ice and keeping things cold.  I really don't notice a difference.  However, the top on the Yeti is superior and is far better and preventing leaks.  Better seal, better slide back opening.However, my 32oz tumbler from an off label brand was under $10.Although Yeti created this market....they no longer own it."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",lid leaks,1.0,"Wife used this for the first time and it leaked.  Never really thought about reading the 1 star reviews on a YETI product, I've had good experiences with them.  But from what the others are saying on 1 stars is this product leaks... often.  Now there may be a manufacturing issue in only SOME of these, who knows.  But all I know is the one we bought for the wife leaks!"
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","Too big, too fat, too heavy.",1.0,Why don’t they make a slender one that many women would like? The most slender one seems like it’s for a man.  It weighs a ton.  I would also like a slick surface in truly pretty colors. Returned it.
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Great Cup! If you work on the computer it's ideal,5.0,"I've been using it every day since I've purchased it. Your liquid stays cold for over an hour. It's really nice since I work on the computer it makes me drink a lot more water throughout the day. I love the lid and magnet slider, it's super easy to use and easy to clean. This is my first Yeti product, but not my last!"
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Good but not great.,4.0,"Pros:1. Superior materials quality, build quality, fit and finish. This cup screams quality and durability.2. Fits easily into my vehicle’s cup holder.3. Very good (but not great) heat retention.Cons:1. Not a great value proposition at 30 bucks.2. Heat retention is very good as stated above. However, I have travel tumblers from Thermos, Contigo and RTIC that ALL equal or outperform the Yeti when it comes to keeping coffee HOT (the Contigo and RTIC are equal to the Yeti with the Thermos blowing them all away by a Country Mile).3. The Mag-Slide lid is not leak or drip proof. And while I give Yeti credit for advising the customer of that fact, it is still a disappointment at this price point. The cup won’t splash and leave you covered in coffee no matter what happens. But it will leak when hitting a bump in the road during your morning commute and drip if turned upside down. None of the other brands I mentioned previously have that problem.  And all are significantly cheaper to purchase than the Yeti tumbler."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Real YETI with Magslide Lid,5.0,"I received this Saturday directly from YETI as it was labeled on the shipping label return address. Came brand new with a magslider lid and YETI registration documents. I believe some on here are fake, just make sure to select the right color and provider. I purchased the all black. Threw it in the dishwasher and used it today for coffee and water. No issues, hot is hot, cold is cold. Exactly what I wanted. Also, perfectly fits my cup holder, not sure why some reviewers say it doesn't? I have a standard 3series BMW with normal cupholder, no issues."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Is it supposed to be licking?,3.0,"I’ve been using the same hydro flask bottle for years, and finally decided to upgrade it. My first YETI product, which I was very excited about. But my first experience turned into a little bit of frustration this morning. Because the cup is licking. Is it normal? Or was it a fake bottle?For anyone who values to have their drink securely held - probably not the best choice.But if you are not traveling too much or planning to use it at home or just to let it sit in the car- should be alright.Other than that it keeps the drink hot, and I love the design and material. Wish my experience would turn out better.Thinking to return it, as I already have 2 Starbucks mugs that are licking .."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Real yeti?,1.0,"Love the cup, but it says my registration code is already in use...which makes me wonder it my cup is actually a yeti. This also prohibits me from getting a sticker pack..."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Quality but over priced,5.0,Good quality.  Works great and keeps my coffee hot.  It is about 20% over priced in my opinion.
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",I was sent a cup with rust in the bottom,3.0,"I bought this for taking coffee to work and for making coffee at work. For those purposes this works great. It keeps my coffee warm for a long time and when I use it for ice water it keeps the water nice and cool. I rated this product lower based on the retailer, I was sent a cup with a tiny rust stain at the bottom. I washed the cup and used it before noticing.I also bought the handle and I enjoy using this cup with that handle.For use and function I give the Rambler an AFor Yeti who sent me a defective product, I give them a 'D', the least they could have done is discounted the product."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Lid is not leak proof!,2.0,"The lid is not leak proof, on either of the 2 tumblers (diff colors) I ordered. I ensured I had it closed properly (and all the way) and when it is barely tipped my coffee almost pours out, let alone my husbands who has his in his work truck that bounces all over, he was surprised to find a small puddle in his cup holder. Very disappointed with the lid, the cup itself seems sturdy and durable, but the lid is terrible and not worth to hold our coffee. Maybe it is better for something else."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","Leaked from day 1, my own fault for thinking Yeti/Amazon had a better return/exchange policy",2.0,"I bought a 30oz tumbler maybe a year ago and love it.  I drink everything out of it and no longer use any of the large number of Tervis tumblers I've accumulated over the years.  I bought my wife a 20oz one on Amazon (Official Yeti Amazon aothorized storefront July 16th.  We noticed the first time using it that it didn't seem to have the same quality of lid seal as mine.  We thought maybe after some use/washing it may ""work in"" or maybe just that size/model had different engineering/tolerance.  Either way it wasn't a huge deal.  It doesn't leak under normal use, except if turned up when it's nearly empty.  But 100%, you can still put any liquid in mine after hundreds of uses, put the lid on it and turn it upside down and not a drop would leak, even completely full.  I recently bought a 20oz tumbler myself, from the same seller, and the lid is perfectly sealed and won't leak or dislodge unless it's dropped from a decent height, and even then it usually stays on.  I was wanting to get an exchange for my wife's but I now find out that Amazon's 30 day return window has passed, and because I didn't get it on Yeti.com, I can't exchange it there either.  It won't keep me from buying them in the future, but rest assured if I have a problem at all, it's getting returned.  Tervis at least has a lifetime warranty, despite otherwise being a subpar product.Edit:Not long after I ended up ordering a replacement lid, I did some more investigating and found that it was not the lid, but in fact the mug itself that was to blame.  I found this out by swapping lids with my own and it still leaked.  I also put this lid from the ""faulty"" mug on mine and it worked fine.  I examined the physical characteristics of each mug to look for defects/damage, and found that there is a small difference in engineering specs between the two.  I thought maybe one was a knock off, but I ordered them both from the authorized Amazon storefront and the lids work identically well on mine (no leaks, NEARLY leak proof but you basically had to drop it from waist high on a hard surface to jostle it).  Also, the manufacturer's inscriptions are identical except for a number which I assume is like a serial number or batch number.  The ""faulty"" mug actually still had the QR code sticker on the bottom which seemed pretty legit (opened to yeti.com to register product.  Anyhow, in reading a bunch of poor reviews I'm beginning to think I stumbled upon something here.  Properly engineered/manufactured yeti ramblers work very well and are nearly leak proof.  BUT...if you get one of these ""bad batches"" or maybe it's just a mismatched lid, then your experience might not be the same.  I did end up calling Yeti support since my purchase here was past 30 days, and after explaining the issue, it seems that they are going to take care of the issue, I just need to send them pictures of the rambler.  I'll update if they end up not honoring that.  In the picture, the white one is the one that leaked with two different lids.  The red one is rock solid with either lid.  Notice the difference in how thick the stainless steel part is.  It's subtle, and probably not the actual cause of the leaking problem, but indicates that there is a difference between the two."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",This one is juuuust right,5.0,"My father used a certain travel mug for years I’d gotten him in Canada. I’d managed to get him a couple of replacements but eventually you couldn’t get them anymore… tragedy. Thus began the hunt for a new travel mug. With each contender we discovered new traits that were desirable/undesirable. Apparently for my dad a lot of it is in the lid. The mechanism which covers the opening has to be easy to open (check), and the opening itself must allow for a good but controllable amount of coffee to be poured into ones mouth (check, check).My dad doesn’t much care that it keeps the coffee very warm. He wants it to cool slightly so he can drink it all on his drive to work, then it stays in the car. But it does stay warm and once the lid is on, that lid is on. Anyone with difficulty with their hands might have trouble with the lid and find a screw on/off type better.If I need a new travel mug this is likely what I’ll get myself. I’d certainly recommend it."
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White",Doesn't hold up to the hype,3.0,"This tumbler feels and looks nice (I was a bit disappointed in the color), and it it does a pretty good job of keeping my coffee hot. It does not, however, live up to all the hype I've heard about how long it keeps drinks hot. While it does keep my coffee hot longer than some other insulated tumblers that I've used, it's not effective enough to justify the extra cost. I'm sure there are tumblers that are just as effective at two thirds the cost.Regarding the color, I admit that it's not far off from the color rendered by my monitor in the item description. But I had hoped for something a little more vibrant. It would have been more accurate to describe this item as being ""tarnished copper"" in color, rather than copper. (This did not effect the rating that I gave it.)"
"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid, White","Solid Product, Comfortable to Hold, and Reliable.",4.0,"It’s a good product.  My hot tea stays pretty hot for up to 6 hours, if the lid is entirely closed most of that time.  Drinks stay hotter in a cheaper Thermos brand cup, but the Yeti is more comfortable to hold and drink from than the Thermos.  I’d say this brand is just slightly overrated, but definitely a solid product and I recommend you try it out.  I’m not sure how it keeps cold drinks, because I haven’t tried that yet."
